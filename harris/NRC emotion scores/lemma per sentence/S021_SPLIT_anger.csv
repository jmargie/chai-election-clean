S021,4,0,"And key, key, to creating this opportunity economy is building up our middle class.",0.0
S021,4,1,It is essential.,0.0
S021,4,2,"The middle class is one of America’s greatest strengths, and to protect it, then, we must defend basic principles, such as your salary should be enough to provide you and your family with a good quality of life, such as no child should have to grow up in poverty, such as after years of hard work, you should be able to retire with dignity, and you should be able to join a union if you choose.",0.047619047619047616
S021,4,3,"Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency because I strongly believe when the middle class is strong, America is strong.",0.0

S021,9,1,He wants to impose what is in effect a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries.,0.0
S021,9,2,That will devastate Americans.,1.0
S021,9,3,It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs.,0.0
S021,9,4,"A Trump tax on gas, a Trump tax on food, a Trump tax on clothing, a Trump tax on over-the-counter medication.",0.0
S021,9,5,And economists have done the math.,0.0

S021,12,0,"As for Donald Trump, well, he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which 45 million Americans rely on, 45 million Americans rely on it for healthcare.",0.0
S021,12,1,That would take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions.,0.14285714285714285
S021,12,2,"We all remember what that was, and we’re not going back.",0.0
S021,13,0,And let’s talk about the cost of housing.,0.0
S021,13,1,"So now, the housing market can be complicated, but look, I’m not new to this issue.",0.0
S021,13,2,"As State Attorney General, I drafted and helped pass a Homeowner Bill of Rights, one of the first in America.",0.16666666666666666
S021,13,3,"And during the foreclosure crisis, I took on the big banks for predatory lending with many of my colleagues, including Roy Cooper, and won $20 billion for California families when I was Attorney General.",0.1
S021,13,4,"So I know how to fight for people who are being exploited in the housing market, and I know what homeownership means.",0.16666666666666666
S021,13,5,It’s more than a financial transaction.,0.0
S021,13,6,It’s so much more than that.,0.0
S021,13,7,It’s more than a house.,0.0
S021,13,8,"Homeownership and what that means, it’s a symbol of the pride that comes with hard work.",0.0
S021,13,9,It’s financial security.,0.0
S021,13,10,It represents what you will be able to do for your children.,0.0
S021,14,0,"And sadly, right now, it is out of reach for far too many American families.",0.0
S021,14,1,There’s a serious housing shortage in many places.,0.3333333333333333
S021,14,2,"It’s too difficult to build, and it’s driving prices up.",0.0

S021,14,4,"We will take down barriers and cut red tape, including at the state and local levels.",0.125
S021,14,5,"And by the end of my first term, we will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class.",0.1
S021,14,6,And we’ll do that together.,0.0
S021,14,7,We’ll do that together.,0.0
S021,15,0,"And we will make sure those homes actually go to working and middle-class Americans, not just investors.",0.0
S021,15,1,"Because some corporate landlords, some of them buy dozens if not hundreds of houses and apartments.",0.0
S021,15,2,"Then, they turn them around and rent them out at extremely high prices, and it can make it impossible then for regular people to be able to buy or even rent a home.",0.0
S021,15,3,"Some corporate landlords collude with each other to set artificially high rental prices, often using algorithms in price-fixing software to do it.",0.0
S021,15,4,"It’s anticompetitive, and it drives up costs.",0.0
S021,15,5,I will fight for a law that cracks down on these practices.,0.25
S021,16,0,"We also know that as the price of housing has gone up, the size of down payments have gone up as well.",0.0
S021,16,1,"Even if aspiring homeowners save for years, it often still is not enough.",0.0
S021,16,2,"So in addition, while we work on the housing shortage, my administration will provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 to help with the down payment on a new home.",0.125
S021,16,3,"We can do this, we can do this.",0.0
S021,16,4,All to help more Americans experience the pride of homeownership and the financial security that it represents and brings.,0.0
S021,17,0,"So that’s my plan, but here’s what Donald Trump would do.",0.0
S021,17,1,"If his Project 2025 agenda is put into effect, it will add around $1,200 a year to the typical American mortgage.",0.0
S021,17,2,He’s got it backward.,0.0
S021,17,3,"We should be doing everything we can to make it more affordable to buy a home, not less.",0.0
S021,18,0,"Finally, there’s one more way I will help families deal with rising cost, and that’s by letting you keep more of your hard-earned money.",0.2
S021,18,1,"Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut, and we will do this by restoring two tax cuts designed to help middle-class and working Americans, the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, through which millions of Americans with children got to keep more of their hard-earned income.",0.0
S021,18,2,"We know this works and has a direct impact on so many issues, including child poverty.",0.16666666666666666
S021,18,3,We know it works.,0.0
S021,18,4,"So as President, I’ll not only restore that tax cut but expand it.",0.0
S021,18,5,"We will provide $6,000 in tax relief to families during the first year of a child’s life.",0.0
S021,19,0,"Now, think what that means.",0.0
S021,19,1,Think what that means.,0.0
S021,19,2,"That is a vital, vital year of critical development of a child, and the cost can really add up, especially for young parents who need to buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else.",0.0
S021,19,3,And we will do this while reducing the deficit.,0.0
S021,19,4,Compare my plan with what Donald Trump intends to do.,0.0
S021,19,5,"He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts, year after year, and he plans to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars even as they pull in record profits.",0.0
S021,19,6,"And that’s on top of the $2 trillion tax cut he already signed into law when he was President, which by the way, overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly, went to the wealthiest Americans and corporations and exploded the national deficit.",0.08333333333333333
S021,19,7,"I think that if you want to know who someone cares about, look who they fight for.",0.5
S021,19,8,Look who they fight for.,1.0
S021,19,9,Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations.,0.25
S021,19,10,"We, I will fight to give money back to working and middle-class Americans.",0.4
S021,20,0,So I’ll end with this.,0.0
S021,20,1,"Two days ago, Donald Trump was here in North Carolina.",0.0
S021,20,2,He said he was going to talk about the economy.,0.0
S021,20,3,"I think you all watched, you know what I’m about to say.",0.0
S021,20,4,"But he offered no serious plans to reduce cost for middle-class families, no plan to expand access to housing or healthcare.",0.0
S021,20,5,"And that, actually, I think for most of us was not surprising because we already know his plans.",0.0
S021,20,6,We know the Project 2025 agenda.,0.0
S021,20,7,So there’s a choice in this election.,0.0
S021,20,8,"Donald Trump’s plans to devastate the middle class, punish working people, and make the cost of living go up for millions of Americans, and on the other hand, when I’m elected President, what we will do to bring down costs, increase the security and stability financially of your family, and expand opportunity for working and middle-class Americans.",0.041666666666666664
S021,21,0,"So now, now, now is the time to chart a new way forward.",0.0
S021,21,1,"Now is the time to chart a new way forward, to build …",0.0
S021,22,0,"To build an America where everyone’s work is rewarded and talents are valued, where we work with labor and business to strengthen the American economy, and where everyone has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead.",0.0
S021,22,1,"So I thank you, North Carolina.",0.0
S021,22,2,"We’re going to get this done, and with your help, God bless you and God bless the United States of America.",0.0
S021,22,3,God bless you.,0.0
