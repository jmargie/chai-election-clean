She was a small business owner. I love our small businesses. My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses knowing they are part of the backbone of America’s economy. My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations, which will result in $5 trillion to America’s deficit. My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump’s sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month. Economists have said that that Trump sales tax would actually result for middle class families in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should be the backs of middle class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires.",S045,0.04838709677419355
1,"I have talked with women around our country. You wanna talk about this is what people wanted. Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term suffering from a miscarriage being denied care in an emergency room because the healthcare providers are afraid they might go to jail and she’s bleeding out in a car in the parking lot. She didn’t want that. Her husband didn’t want that. A 12 or 13-year-old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to turn, they don’t want that. And I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade as President of the United States. I will proudly sign it into law. But understand if Donald Trump were to be reelected, he will sign a national abortion ban. Understand in his project 2025, there would be a national abortion, a monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages. I think the American people that certain freedoms in particular, the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body should not be made by the government.",S045,0.017857142857142856
2,"And you know why? Because he’d prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And understand this comes at a time where the people of our country actually need a leader who engages in solutions, who actually addresses the problems at hand. But what we have in the former president is someone who would prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And I’ll tell you something, he’s gonna talk about immigration a lot tonight, even when it’s not the subject that is being raised. And I’m gonna actually do something really unusual and I’m gonna invite you to attend one of Donald Trump’s rallies. ’cause it’s a really interesting thing to watch. You’ll see during the course of his rallies, he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about windmills cause cancer. And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom. And I will tell you the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you, you will not hear him talk about your needs, your dreams, and your need and your desires. And I’ll tell you, I believe you deserve a president who actually puts you first. And I pledge to you that I will",S045,0.037037037037037035
3,"The values I bring to the importance of home ownership, knowing not everybody got handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times is a value that I bring to my work to say we are going to work with the private sector and home builders to increase 3 million homes, increase by 3 million homes by the end of my first term. My work that is related to having a friend when I was in high school who was sexually assaulted by her stepfather. And my focus then on protecting women and children from violent crime is based on a value that is deeply grounded in the importance of standing up for those who are most vulnerable. My work that is about protecting social security and Medicare is based on longstanding work that I have done protecting seniors from scams. My values have not changed. And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down and name calling. The true measure of the leader is the leader who actually understands the strength is not in beating people down. It’s in lifting people up. I intend to be that president,",S045,0.08823529411764706

And if that was a bridge too far for you, well there is a place in our campaign for you to stand, for country to stand for our democracy, to stand for rule of law and to end the chaos and to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy. ’cause you don’t like the outcome. And be clear on that point, Donald Trump, the candidate has said in this election there will be a bloodbath if this and the outcome of this election is not to his liking. Let’s turn the page on this.

5,"If Donald Trump were President, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now and understand what that would mean. Because Putin’s agenda is not just about Ukraine. Understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer president, and that we understand the importance of the greatest military alliance the world is ever known, which is nato and what we have done to preserve the ability of zelensky and the Ukrainians to fight for their independence. Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe, starting with Poland. And why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch?",S045,0.03571428571428571
6,"And the president at the time invited the Taliban to Camp David, a place of storied significance for us as Americans, a place where we honor the importance of American diplomacy, where we invite and receive respected world leaders. And this former president as president invited them to camp David because he does not, again, appreciate the role and responsibility of the President of the United States to be Commander-in-chief with a level of respect. And this gets back to the point of how he has consistently disparaged and demeaned members of our military fallen soldiers, and the work that we must do to uphold the strength and the respect of the United States of America around the world.",S045,0.05
7,"The Central Park five took out a full page ad calling for their execution. This is the same individual who spread birth or lies about the first black president of the United States. And I think the American people want better than that. Want better than this? Once someone who understands, as I do, I travel our country, we see in each other a friend, we see in each other a neighbor. We don’t want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. I meet with people all the time who tell me, can we please just have discourse about how we’re going to invest in the aspirations and the ambitions and the dreams of the American people, knowing that regardless of people’s color or the language their grandmother speaks, we all have the same dreams and aspirations and want a president who invest in those not in hate and division.",S045,0.07692307692307693

No, you don’t get rid of the Affordable Care Act. You have no plan. And what the Affordable Care Act has done is eliminate the ability of insurance companies to deny people with preexisting conditions. I don’t have to tell the people watching tonight, you remember what that was like. Remember when an insurance company could deny if a child had asthma, if someone was a breast cancer survivor, if a, if a grandparent had diabetes. And thankfully, as I’ve been vice president and we over the last four years have strengthened the Affordable Care Act, we have allowed for the first time Medicare to negotiate drug prices on behalf of you.

And when I am president, we will do that for all people. Understanding that the value I bring to this is that access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.

And I’ll tell you, as a prosecutor, I never asked a victim or a witness, are you a Republican or a Democrat? The only thing I ever ask them, are you okay? And that’s the kind of president we need right now. Someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first.
