0,"So thank you. And Tonya Pendleton, I want to thank you for being the moderator of this discussion and then in his absence, but he sends his best, Senator Bob Casey. I want to thank him for all he does. So this is intended to be a discussion about student loan debt, but really it is, from my perspective, a discussion about who are our public servants and what we as a society and as a country owe them for the gift that they possess and then give to so many people, often without the praise on a daily basis that they deserve, but their value to the strength of our country, their value to our well-being is immeasurable.",S040,0.037037037037037035
1,"And who are our public servants? They are teachers, they are nurses, they’re firefighters, they’re police officers, they’re librarians, they’re bus drivers, and social workers. They are people who have dedicated themselves to serving the public, often serving on behalf of people that they otherwise had never met and would otherwise have no obligation to other than the fact that they care and they understand the strength and the importance of lifting up other people and by extension, all of us.",S040,0.0
2,"Our public servants then do some of the most noble and selfless work that anyone can do. I think about our teachers, our teachers who have the calling to teach other people’s children and to do that work often without the resources they need. Most of the teachers, public school teachers I have met over the years come out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies. We don’t pay our teachers nearly what they deserve in terms of the value that they give to society as a whole. And I will say that also as a proud public school, former public school student. My first grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, God rest her, attended my law school graduation, wouldn’t be here except for the strength of our teachers. And, of course, the family in which I was raised.",S040,0.023255813953488372
3,"School nurses, nurses office. Many of us had the good fortune of attending schools where there was a school nurse. But sadly, we have not supported our nurses enough so that we can have enough of them in the pipeline to serve all of the schools that need a school nurse. But our school nurses are, they are leaders. They are known by the students. They are known as the people who care for the students. Often, the nurse’s office is an oasis of comfort and sanctity for so many students. Our social workers who help children in foster care, children who have, through no fault of their own, been in circumstances where they need the support and they need the encouragement of a social worker to help them know that they are special and important. This is who our public servants are, and yet many are silently struggling with student loan debt.",S040,0.02040816326530612
4,"God knows we don’t pay them enough in the first place, but so many of them nonetheless, will choose to stay in these important roles because it is a calling for them. Whereas they could potentially opt into a different profession with their skills that would pay them more, but they stay where they are because they care. And we as a society and a country should reciprocate that care by alleviating the burden that so many of them are caring with this enormous debt that prevents them from being able to get through the month stress-free, prevents them, in many cases, from being able to buy a home or even start a family. And so the work that President Biden and I have been doing throughout the last three years has been to address one of the big issues facing not only our public servants, but many people who carry student loan debt, which is, what can we do to relieve some of the burden?",S040,0.0
5,"Because we do believe not only for public service, but most people should not have to carry this kind of worry. And so far then we have forgiven, on average, $70,000 of student loan debt for over 850,000 public servants. And for folks in general, we have forgiven over $144 billion for over four million people. And that means, of course, for those individuals who have received this for forgiveness, that’s more money in their pocket to pay for things like child care, more money in their pocket to get through the month in terms of rent or mortgage. And so today then building on the work that we’ve done thus far, I’m announcing a new plan to forgive more loans for 25 million more Americans, including millions of our public servants. And that means, for example, if you’ve paid undergrad loans for 20-plus years or graduate loans for 25 or more years, your loans will be completely forgiven regardless of your income and even if you did not graduate.",S040,0.03636363636363636
6,"So I’m going to repeat that. If you’ve paid undergraduate loans for more than 20 years or graduate loans for more than 25 years, those loans will be completely forgiven regardless of your income and even if you did not graduate. And forgiveness will be automatic for the vast majority of the 25 million people that we believe will benefit from this approach. And to see if you could be eligible, I would urge everyone to go to studentaid.gov. That’s studentaid.gov. And I’ll close with this.",S040,0.0
7,"The president and I continue to do and will do much more to build on this work. Again, understanding that we want to create incentives for people to acquire the kinds of skills, like the professionals at this table, to do the work that they do that benefits so many others and benefits all of us as a nation. And so I thank the leaders who are at this table for being willing to tell your stories in a way that I think will inspire others to apply for the forgiveness and to do the work that we know can be done to honor our public servants and so many others. And with that, I’m going to turn it over to Tonya Pendleton to moderate our conversation.",S040,0.0
