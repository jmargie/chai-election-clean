You came right from the game. Congratulations. Give them a big applause, right? Well done, well done. So in all seriousness, everyone, before I begin, I want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene, and please have a seat if you’re able. I want to talk about Hurricane Helene for a moment, and I know that everyone here sends their thoughts and prayers for the folks who have been so devastated by that hurricane and the ensuing events in Florida, in Georgia, the Carolinas and other impacted states. And we know that so many have been impacted, some have died. But I want to thank everyone for doing everything you can to think about them, send them your thoughts, send them your prayers.

It is good to be with all the leaders who are here, including Representative Susie Lee, who is here, Steven Horsford, Dina Titus, the great General Ford, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Senator Jacky Rosen, who we’re going to send back to the United States Senate. Thank you, everyone and all the local leaders here. There are so many leaders here. It is good to be back with you.",S007,0.0
2,"So Las Vegas, we have 37 days until the election, 37 days. And we know this will be a tight race until the very end. And let’s level set. We are the underdog. We are the underdog, and we have some hard work ahead. But here’s the thing, we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. And with your help, we will win in November. Yes, we will. Yes, we will. Yes, we will. We will win.",S007,0.0
3,"But listen, also, their debate should not be the last word. I’m trying to debate Donald Trump again, and I think he should debate again. The American people have a right to hear us discuss the issues. And as you say here in Las Vegas, I’m all in. I’m all in. Even if my opponent is ready to fold. So there you go.",S007,0.015873015873015872

6,"America is ready to chart a new way forward, ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership, which is why Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are supporting our campaign because we know we need a president who works for all the American people. Enough of the division. Enough of the hate. We are all in this together. And you all know from my entire career, I’ve only had one client, the people, the people.",S007,0.0
7,"From being a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators. As Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by for-profit colleges, for workers who are being cheated out of their wages. And I pledge to you as president, I will fight for all Americans and together we will build a brighter future for our nation. We will build a future that includes thinking about our economy in a way that it is about lifting everyone up. We will build what I call an opportunity economy so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business.",S007,0.015151515151515152
8,"And let me tell you, I love our small businesses, of which I’ve met so many right here in Vegas. Growing up, our mother worked very long hours. And so my sister Maya and I would go over two doors down to Ms. Shelton’s house. We called her our second mother. And Ms. Shelton was a small business owner. So I know since I was a young child who our small businesses are, who our small business owners are. Small businesses are the backbone of America’s economy. I know that. I know that. And Latina small business owners are the fastest growing segment of our economy.",S007,0.009433962264150943
9,"So my plan is about tapping into that ambition, those aspirations, those dreams, those incredible ideas, that strong work ethic that people have. Also understanding not everybody gets handed $4 million on a silver platter and files for bankruptcy six times.",S007,0.024390243902439025
10,"So my plan is about saying we’ve got to help entrepreneurs, startups out. And I will give a $50,000 tax deduction to help entrepreneurs start their small businesses. Because right now that tax deduction is $5,000. Can’t nobody start a small business in 2024. So we are going to make it something where it is doable to lift folks up. We also need to build more housing in America.",S007,0.0
11,"My mother saved up for years till I was a teenager when she was able to buy our first home. And right now a serious housing shortage is part of what is driving up cost. So we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes and provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 down payment assistance so you can just get your foot in the door. You’ll do the rest.",S007,0.01282051282051282
12,"And we must lower the cost of living because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it.

13,"And in two days, I know we will cheer on Coach Walz when he debates JD Vance. Yeah.",S007,0.0
14,"And so as president, part of how I’m going to push this forward is I will get rid of unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs, understanding that having a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a worker. And when we do that with the federal workforce, I’m coming to ask the private sector to challenge you to do the same. So all of this is the same. I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. Now Donald Trump has a different plan. Just Google Project 2025, which I have to say I still can’t believe they put that thing in writing. They printed it up, they bound it, they handed it out.",S007,0.0072992700729927005
15,"Just Google it. It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he would do if he were elected again, as president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive cuts again, cut Social security and Medicare, and impose what I call a Trump sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday basic necessities, which economists have measured would cost the average family nearly 4,000 more dollars a year in everyday expenses. And on top of all this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act, and he has no plan to replace it. He has “concepts of a plan,” concepts.",S007,0.0
16,"So here’s the thing though. We can laugh about many things, but the consequences of this are quite serious, quite serious. Because think about it. He’s going to threaten health coverage and health insurance for 45 million people in our country based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions? You remember what that was like? Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We will move forward, and we’ll take on the biggest issues facing our nation. We have talked about the economy. We have talked about what we can do in terms of investing in the ambition, the aspirations of our country. We will take on the issue of immigration. We will take on a number of issues on the subject of immigration. We must have comprehensive immigration reform with strong border of security and an earned pathway to citizenship, including for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years, including our dreamers, including our dreamers. And I was Attorney General of a border state.",S007,0.016042780748663103
17,"I prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. And as president, I will double the resources for the Department of Justice to go after those transnational cartels and take action to stop the flow of fentanyl coming into our country, which is destroying entire communities. These are serious problems, and we know Donald Trump won’t solve them. When he was president, he did nothing to fix our immigration system. And earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan board of security bill in decades, and Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought that that bill, if passed, would’ve hurt him and he’d prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. That’s not the kind of president we want. As president, he cruelly separated families and plans to do it again. And he continues to fan the flames of fear and division. Look, we need a president who cares more about solving problems than playing political games and demeaning people full-time. I’m tired of that. We’re done with that. So Nevada, ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court, the court of Thurgood and RBG, so that they would do as they did and overturn the protections of Roe V. Wade. And now, one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. It is immoral, immoral. And let us agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn’t be telling her what to do. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government telling her what to do with",S007,0.02601156069364162
18,"… price gouging that we know has resulted in jacking prices up, often around tragedies and emergencies. We will give a tax cut to a hundred million more Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child’s life, knowing that the vast majority of our young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources to do it. And that $6,000 in extending and expanding the child tax credit will help buying a crib, buying a car seat, doing the things that are so critical in that first phase of life. I will also make sure good paying jobs are available to all Americans, not only those with college degrees, because we need to recognize the value of additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs.",S007,0.0
