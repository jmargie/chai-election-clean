Not to mention what we learned about in the last 24 hours in terms of the killing of Navalny. So this is about where we stand as a nation. And as it relates to the supplemental, we have been clear, the President and I both in private conversations with members of the United States Congress and in public, we are clear and certain that for the majority in both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representative, there is bipartisan support for this approach. There is bipartisan support for what America is and what we stand for. And we are unwavering and that has nothing to do with an election cycle. It has to do with who we are and what kind of country we want to be, one that stands with our friends. President Zelenskyy?",S042,0.017964071856287425
1,"I also believe that there is consensus across party lines in the United States Congress that recognizes the brutal nature of Moscow’s aggression and that there must be a response that includes standing by our friends and supporting those who fight against that aggression. And I do believe there is consensus within the United States Congress that the American leadership, elected leaders in the United States Congress must be unified in their opposition to Russia’s aggression as indicated over the course of the last 2+ years and the last 24 hours. And I do believe also there is consensus within the United States Congress that we must use everything that is available to us to support Ukraine in its fight to become and to maintain itself as an independent and democratic nation.",S042,0.045454545454545456
