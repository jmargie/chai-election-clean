It’s good that sometimes the cameras are not in the room when he has those conversations. Because the thing about the Joe Biden I know, and I know you know, because he has been a friend of labor for so long for his whole life, Joe Biden can be quite impatient. And that’s a good thing for that kind of leader. Quite impatient. And I say to all of the friends here, the press that’s in the room, history will show what we here know. Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents in the United States that we have ever witnessed, and it comes from his heart.",S047,0.0
1,"And you know, Joe and I talk a lot about the fact that we are so proud to be the most pro-Union administration in America’s history. [inaudible 01:06:22]. And as we know, Joe’s still got a lot of work to do, so let’s also understand that.",S047,0.0
2,"So I want to thank all the incredible leaders who are here today, including the Governor Shapiro, Lieutenant Governor Davis, Senator Casey, who we will re-elect this November.

3,"I love Labor Day. I love celebrating Labor Day. And Pittsburgh, of course, is a cradle of the American labor movement. It is the birthplace of the AFL, headquarters of the Steelworkers, home to Firefighters Local 1, and of course the historic IBEW Local 5. For more than 150 years, the brothers and sisters of labor have helped lead the fight for fair pay, better benefits and safe working conditions. And every person in our nation has benefited from that work. Everywhere I go, I tell people, “You may not be a union member, but you better thank unions for that five-day work week. Thank unions for sick leave. Thank unions for paid family leave. Thank unions for your vacation time.” Because when union wages go up, everybody’s wages go up. When union workplaces are safer, all workplaces are safer. When unions are strong, America is strong.",S047,0.013605442176870748
4,"And we are clear. Not only has Pittsburgh shaped the history of America’s labor movement, today, you are also shaping its future. In 2021 with my dear friend the secretary, Marty Walsh, who the president appointed to be Secretary of Labor. He and I hosted a meeting right here in this local, and it was part of the White House labor task force that I lead. That day, we met with a group of computer programmers who were working to form a union. One month later, they signed their contract and became one of the first technology unions in our nation, standing on the shoulder of all those who have been here and fought the good fight. So Pittsburgh, I remind us of that to say together, we are fighting to build an economy that works for all working people. And that has always been the vision of the labor movement, and that is the vision of our campaign.",S047,0.012578616352201259
5,"In this election, there are two very different visions for our nation, one, ours focused on the future, the other focused on the past. We fight for the future. We fight for a future of dignity, respect, and opportunity for all people. We fight knowing it’s some backward thinking for those folks who have been suggesting for years that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. That’s the stuff they’re pushing, that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. When we know the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up, who you lift up. Do you fight for workers? Do you fight for families? Do you fight for those who must be seen and heard and deserve the dignity that comes with hard work? That’s what we fight for. And when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for.",S047,0.05389221556886228

We love our country, and we know it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country, and that’s what this election is about, and about the promise of America.

8,"We, we see and know and fight for a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead.

9,"Because of course, that’s the nature of who we are as Americans. We have dreams. We can see what is possible, unburdened by what has been. We have aspirations, we have ambitions. And the system that is a good system is one that supports that and allows people the opportunity to go where they can see and imagine themselves to be. That’s what I’m talking about when I talk about an opportunity economy. We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity.

10,"And we will continue to strengthen America’s manufacturing sector. And on that point, the president mentioned it, US Steel is an historic American company and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies.

So friends, 64 days until the most election of our lives and probably one of the most important in the life of our nation, truly. And we know this is going to be a tight race to the very end. It’s going to be a tight race to the very end.
