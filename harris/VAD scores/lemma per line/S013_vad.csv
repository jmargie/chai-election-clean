I’ve always been and will always be, and be clear about this. I’ve always been and will always be a strong supporter of workers and unions, and I also believe we need to engage those who create most of the jobs in America. Look, I’m a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets. I believe in consistent and transparent rules of the road to create a stable business environment. And I know the power of American innovation. I’ve been working with entrepreneurs and business owners my whole career. And I believe companies need to play by the rules, respect the rights of workers and unions, and abide by fair competition. And if they don’t, I will hold them accountable. And if anyone has a question about that, just look at my record as Attorney General.

S013,2,"So let’s start then with the first pillar of an opportunity economy, which is lowering costs. So I made that our top priority for obvious reasons, because if we want the middle class to be the growth engine of our economy, we need to restore basic economic security for middle-class families. To that end, the most practical thing we can do right now, is to cut taxes for middle-class families and individuals. And that’s what we’ll do. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a middle-class tax break that includes $6,000 for new parents during the first year of their child’s life to help families cover everything from car seats to cribs. We’ll also cut the cost of child care and elder care.

I know caregiving is about dignity. It really is. And when we lower the cost and ease the burdens people face, we will not only make it then easier for them to meet their obligations as caregivers, we will also make it more possible for them to go to work, and pursue their economic aspirations.

We will cut the red tape that stops homes from being built and take on in addition, corporate landlords who are hiking rental prices. And we will work with builders and developers to construct 3 million new homes and rentals for the middle class because increasing the housing supply will help drive down the cost of housing. We will also help first-time home buyers just get their foot in the door with the $25,000 down payment assistance.

S013,36,"From our earliest days, America’s economic strength has been tied to our industrial strength. And the same is true today. So I will recommit the nation to global leadership in the sectors that will define the next century. We will invest in biomanufacturing and aerospace, remain dominant in AI and quantum computing, blockchain, and other emerging technologies, expand our lead in clean energy innovation and manufacturing, so the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to geothermal, to advanced nuclear are not just invented, but built here in America by American workers.",0.680913043478261,0.4900217391304348,0.6841086956521739
S013,37,"And we will invest in the industries that, for example, made Pittsburgh the steel city by offering tax credits for expanding good union jobs in steel and iron and manufacturing communities like here in Mon Valley. And across all these industries of the future, we will prioritize investments for strengthening factory towns. This is so important. For strengthening factory towns, retooling existing factories, hiring locally, and working with unions. Because no one who grows up in America’s greatest industrial or agricultural centers should be abandoned. And understand what that means for real people, people we know, people we care about. We don’t have to abandon a strength we’ve known to achieve a strength that we plan. And",0.6689354838709678,0.4562258064516128,0.6474838709677418

And let’s start with something I can do as president was ensure that we do that for the half million of federal jobs that are within our ability to make it so, showing what is possible and then challenging the private sector to make a similar commitment to emphasizing skills and not just degrees.",0.6555555555555557,0.43531111111111115,0.6103777777777777

That’s not in ecclesiastics, but … Just swapped script for a minute, mayor. But the simple truth is, in America, it takes too long and it costs too much to build. Whether it’s a new housing development, a new factory, or a new bridge, projects take too long to go from concept to reality. It happens in blue states, it happens in red states, and it’s a national problem.",0.640904761904762,0.4237142857142856,0.5721190476190476

As president, if things are not moving quickly, I will demand to know why and I will act. I will work with Congress, workers and businesses, cities and states, community groups and local leaders to reform permitting, to cut red tape and get things moving faster because, look, as I said, patience may be a virtue, but not when it comes to job creation or America’s competitiveness. Many of you know, the Empire State Building, you know how long it took to build that? One year. The Pentagon, you know how long that took? 16 months.

S013,43,"Now look, my opponent, Donald Trump. Well, he makes big promises on manufacturing. Just yesterday he went out and promised to bring back manufacturing jobs. And if that sounds familiar, it should. In 2016, he went out and made that very same promise about the Carrier plant in Indianapolis. You’ll remember Carrier then offshored hundreds of jobs to Mexico under his watch. And it wasn’t just there. On Trump’s watch, offshoring went up and manufacturing jobs went down across our country and across our economy. All told, almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during his presidency starting before the pandemic hit, making Trump one of the biggest losers ever on manufacturing.",0.590566037735849,0.498056603773585,0.5822641509433962
S013,44,"Donald Trump also talked a big game on our trade deficit with China, but it is far lower under our watch than any year of his administration. While he constantly got played by China, I will never hesitate to take swift and strong measures when China undermines the rules of the road at the expense of our workers, our communities, and our companies, whether it’s flooding the market with steel, inferior or at all, unfairly subsidizing shipbuilding, or hurting our small businesses with counterfeits. Recall, Donald Trump actually shipped advanced semiconductor chips to China, which helps them upgrade their military.

And the city where Alan Newell and Herbert Simon launched the first AI research hub at Carnegie Mellon and created entirely new fields like machine learning. And Carnegie Mellon is now home to the largest university robotics center in America. So the proud heritage of Pittsburgh, I so strongly believe reveals the character of our nation, a nation that harnesses the ambitions, the dreams, and the aspirations of our people, seizes the opportunities before us because we see them, because we believe in them, and then invents the future.
