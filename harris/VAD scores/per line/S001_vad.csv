S001,0,"And it is a moment we’re born out of our love of our country, born out of, for me, having taken the oath of office to the Constitution, United States, at least six times. I believe what is at stake in this election is so fundamental for us as Americans. And it is about do we take seriously the importance of a president who obeys the oath to be loyal to the Constitution of the United States? Do we prioritize a President of the United States who cares about rule of law, much less the spirit with which they approach this most powerful position?",0.6801333333333333,0.46883333333333327,0.6626999999999998
S001,1,"There’s so much about this last era. When I talk about turn the page, that’s what I’m referring to. The last decade, that has been about some powerful forces suggesting that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what I think most of us believe, regardless of your party affiliation, that the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.",0.669625,0.5494375,0.6590625

S001,3,"As vice president of the United States, my priorities have been many, including, to your point, the work that you and I have done over the years focusing on women’s health. One of my priorities has been maternal mortality. But I have only had one client in my career, the people. And my belief is that there is great nobility in public service if one understands that they hold the office in the public trust. It is not about personal power. It is about what you can do that lifts up the condition of people. And there is so much about how I think about my responsibility, and I’m here to ask for your vote, is that I intend to be a president for all Americans, understanding that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.",0.6608000000000002,0.4259142857142857,0.5927714285714286
S001,4,"And this era that was initiated by Donald Trump has not only been exhausting, it has been harmful to us as a nation. The notion that a president of the United States would encourage Americans to point fingers at each other? That there would be a suggestion that we are a divided country, instead of knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us? I have, as vice president, met over a hundred and fifty world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. My most recent overseas trips as vice president, which were relatively close to then the election, our allies have expressed real concern.",0.5846296296296296,0.44003703703703706,0.5531481481481482
S001,5,"Our children are now learning how to keep themselves safe if there’s an active shooter at their school. I did a tour last year of colleges with college-aged kids, so I also did some trade schools, and I would ask at the room, the auditorium would be packed, college-aged kids, and I’d ask them, “Raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade, you had to endure an active shooter drill.” Almost every hand went up. Our kids are growing up where they are learning that they may be unsafe in the classroom, where they should be absorbing the wonders of the world. One kid said to me, “Yeah, we were talking about this,” and said to me, “Yeah, that’s why I don’t like going to fifth period.” I said, “Why, sweetheart? Why don’t you like going to fifth period?” ” Because in that classroom, there’s no closet in which to hide.”",0.611,0.44305882352941184,0.4993235294117647
S001,6,"So when we think of this issue, we must also consider the direct trauma for those who have been directly affected by gun violence, including that to our kids who are in schools across our country doing this.

S001,7,"That there are certain things in particularly the matters of national security, where it’s not about partisanship, it’s about where should America stand in terms of supporting our allies and standing for certain principles. I’ll give you as a point of reference for me in terms of how I feel about this on the partisan issue. For the four years that I was in the United States Senate, my favorite committee was the Senate Intelligence Committee. And I served on that committee and we would meet in a room that’s called a SCIF, and it’s basically a, it’s very secure room. No press with all due respect is allowed in, no cameras, everyone has to leave their cell phone outside. It’s a bipartisan committee. And we would go in that room and receive classified information from America’s intelligence communities, sometimes our military leaders about hotspots around the world and threats to our national security.",0.6470232558139536,0.40013953488372084,0.6049534883720931
S001,8,"And when we went in that room, and this is why it was my favorite committee, people would take off their suit jacket, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table, and we weren’t Democrats or Republicans, we were Americans. And that is so important on a number of issues we are discussing this afternoon, but in particular on national security. My opponent, however, has made it a thing of his to admire dictators and autocrats around the world. He exchanged love letters with Kim Jong Un. Remember that? He has openly praised the president of Russia. Most recently, the report is in the height of COVID, remember, everyone was scrambling to get their hands on COVID tests? Remember when Americans were dying by the hundreds every day? And Donald Trump secretly sent COVID tests to the president of Russia for his personal use. He has said, Donald Trump, “I will solve the matter of Ukraine and Russia in a day.”",0.6587647058823528,0.4662352941176471,0.5669411764705883
S001,9,"Read through and understand what he is saying. He would surrender, he would have Ukraine surrender its fight against an aggressor violating its sovereignty. If Donald Trump were president, Vladimir Putin will be sitting in Kyiv. And understand what that would mean for America and our standing around the world. But thankfully there has been bipartisan support, and to your point of where you stand on this very fundamental issue, but this is a very vivid example of what is at stake in this election. Because Donald Trump has been very clear he would give away the shop. He has been manipulated and is so clearly able to be manipulated by favor and flattery, including from dictators and autocrats around the world. And America knows that that is not how we stand, that is not how we fight. We fight in favor of our strength and our role as a leader in bringing the allies together and standing for foundational and fundamental principles.",0.6254999999999998,0.44028947368421056,0.6056578947368421
S001,10,"And it should be a constant reminder to us, we have to remember history, that isolationism, which is exactly what Donald Trump is pushing, pull out a NATO, abandon our friends, isolationism is not insulation. It is not insulation. It will not insulate us from harm in terms of our national security. So I say that to emphasize a point that the congresswoman made. And the other point I’d make is also check out where he’s been on how he thinks about America’s military and service members. One of the great, great American heroes of prisoner of war, John McCain. Remember how he talked about John McCain? He said he didn’t like him because he got caught. He’s called members of our military, suckers and losers. And then look at how some of the highest ranking members of our military, including what I mentioned earlier, the chairman, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a dedicated member, leader in America’s military, how he has assessed Donald Trump, fascism to his core.",0.5651081081081079,0.45818918918918916,0.561972972972973
S001,11,"So I will share with you a specific proposal that is an extension of how I think about things. Actually, personal story, I took care of my mother when she was sick. And for anyone taking care of or who has taken care of an elder relative, you know what that is? It’s about trying to cook something they feel like eating. It is trying to find clothes that don’t irritate their skin or help them put on a sweater. It’s about trying to figure out something",0.6934782608695652,0.4343043478260869,0.5331304347826087
S001,12,"Thank you. And I’ve actually met with members and leaders in the Chaldean community and thank you for being here. I think that there is something at stake that is about core values as well as what is at stake in terms of the risk and the danger. And I would offer you an example of what I think would be an important issue that would affect the Chaldean community and all Americans. For example, the issue of how we think about healthcare in America. So I know enough about the culture and to know that it is reflective of who we are as Americans in general. We respect our elders, we take care of them.",0.6532666666666666,0.45859999999999995,0.5626
S001,13,"Look, I am a capitalist. I am a pragmatic capitalist. I will work as I have with the private sector. I believe we have to invest in America’s economy and America’s industry and America’s entrepreneurs, and we can at the same time take care of those that are the most in need of just a little support to be able to not just get by, but get ahead.",0.6806666666666666,0.43999999999999995,0.6039047619047619
S001,14,"And I say do not despair because in a democracy, as long as we can keep it in our democracy, the people, every individual has the power to make a decision about what this will be. And so let’s not feel powerless. I get it. Overwhelming nature of this all make us feel powerless because then we have been defeated, and that’s not our character as the American people. We are not one to be defeated. We rise to a moment and we stand on broad shoulders of people who have fought this fight before for our country, and in many ways let us look at the challenge then that we are being presented and not be overwhelmed by it.",0.6131142857142858,0.4742857142857143,0.5646857142857142
S001,15,"The baton is now in our hands to fight for, not against, but for this country we love. That’s what we have the power to do. So let’s own that. Dare I say, be joyful in what we will do in the process of owning that, which is knowing that we can and will build community and coalitions and remind people that we’re all in this together. Let’s not let the overwhelming nature of this strip us of our strength. That’s how I feel about this. That’s how I feel about this.",0.6613749999999999,0.48641666666666666,0.6229583333333333
