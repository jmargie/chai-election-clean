And so, we will continue to work around the clock on that, work around the clock also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution. And in that solution, there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel, and in equal measure for the Palestinians. But the one thing I will assure you always, I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran, and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel, but we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination, and the dignity they so rightly deserve.",0.6089047619047618,0.4061666666666667,0.5426666666666667

And it is absolutely well known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again, because they’re so clear they can manipulate you with flattery and favors, and that is why so many military leaders who you have worked with have told me you are a disgrace.

Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kiev with his eyes on the rest of Europe, starting with Poland.

And this former president as president invited them to Camp David, because he does not, again, appreciate the role and responsibility of the President of the United States to be commander-in-chief with a level of respect.

We don’t want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. I meet with people all the time who tell me “Can we please just have discourse about how we’re going to invest in the aspirations and the ambitions and the dreams of the American people?” Knowing that regardless of people’s color or the language their grandmother speaks, we all have the same dreams and aspirations and want a president who invests in those, not in hate and division.",0.663027027027027,0.4578108108108108,0.5846756756756757

The late great John McCain, I will never forget that night, walked onto the Senate floor and said, “No, you don’t get rid of the Affordable Care Act. You have no plan.” And what the Affordable Care Act has done is eliminate the ability of insurance companies to deny people with pre-existing conditions. I don’t have to tell the people watching tonight, you remember what that was like? Remember when an insurance company could deny if a child had asthma, if someone was a breast cancer survivor, if a grandparent had diabetes?

And when I am president, we will do that for all people, understanding that the value I bring to this is that access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.
