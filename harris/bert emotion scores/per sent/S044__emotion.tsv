S044	5	4	And I’ve been here many times, as you all know, recently and even before.	0.6896723508834839
S044	5	5	And many of you know then, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected United States senator, I was an elected attorney general.	0.6729841828346252
S044	5	6	And before that, an elected district attorney.	0.6712934374809265

S044	6	4	So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type.	0.6852433681488037
S044	6	5	I know it’s type.	0.616313636302948
S044	6	6	In fact, I’ve been dealing with people like him my whole career.	0.7042022347450256
S044	6	7	For example, as Attorney General of California… Well hold on, you know what?	0.6778238415718079
S044	6	8	The courts are going to handle that part of it.	0.6693671941757202
S044	6	9	What we’re going to do is beat them in November.	0.6689059734344482
S044	7	0	So I’ll tell you, as Attorney General, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that scammed students.	0.6954668164253235
S044	7	1	Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.	0.6914001107215881

S044	10	1	Any day of the week.	0.609869122505188
S044	11	0	But let’s make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump.	0.6713240742683411
S044	11	1	It’s about two very different visions for our nation.	0.6662911772727966
S044	11	2	Two very different visions.	0.6606157422065735
S044	11	3	One, for us, focused on the future.	0.6517308950424194
S044	11	4	The other, focused on the past.	0.6684478521347046

S044	11	6	We fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to join a union.	0.6716504096984863
S044	12	0	Union strong.	0.6181262135505676
S044	13	0	Because while our economy is doing well, by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high.	0.6717575192451477
S044	13	1	You know it and I know it.	0.6697150468826294
S044	13	2	When I was Attorney General, I went after price fixing schemes.	0.6760590076446533
S044	13	3	And when I am president, it will be a day one priority to fight to bring down prices.	0.6749544739723206
S044	13	4	I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging.	0.6852782964706421
S044	13	5	I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families.	0.6969754099845886
S044	13	6	I will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans.	0.6749754548072815
S044	13	7	And continue to bring manufacturing jobs back to America.	0.65384441614151
S044	13	8	And back to communities like Eau Claire.	0.6671496033668518
S044	14	0	So, all this is to say, strengthening our economy and building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency.	0.6829994320869446
S044	14	1	Because you see, Coach Walz and I know when America’s middle class is strong, America is strong.	0.6825326681137085
S044	14	2	And as we work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to take our nation backward.	0.6541354060173035
S044	14	3	There is so much evidence of that point, there really is.	0.7029833197593689
S044	14	4	But look at most recently, Project 2025 and that agenda.	0.6646938920021057
S044	14	5	Project 2025, if you have some time to take a look at it, I’m telling you it is a plan to weaken the middle class.	0.6732810735702515
S044	14	6	It is a plan to weaken the middle class.	0.6631495356559753
S044	15	0	If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations.	0.6643854975700378
S044	15	1	He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.	0.6583486199378967
S044	15	2	He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis.	0.6533394455909729
S044	15	3	And he intends to end the Affordable Care Act.	0.6642546653747559
S044	16	0	Our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights.	0.6816594004631042
S044	16	1	The freedom to vote, to love who you love openly and with pride.	0.6842597723007202
S044	16	2	And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do.	0.6726363301277161
S044	17	0	And let’s remember the traditions of our great country.	0.6624667048454285
S044	17	1	Generations of Americans before us led in the fight for freedom.	0.6591576933860779
S044	17	2	And now then, as they would expect, the baton is in our hands.	0.6803436875343323
S044	17	3	The baton is in our hands, each and every one of us.	0.6729164123535156
S044	17	4	So we then, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.	0.6570948958396912
S044	17	5	We, who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws and an assault weapons ban.	0.6671390533447266
S044	17	6	We, who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman’s right to choose.	0.6603882908821106
S044	18	0	And we, remember that when he was president, Donald Trump hand-picked three members of the United States Supreme Court, the court of Thurgood and RBG, because he intended for them to overturn Roe v wade.	0.6703905463218689
S044	18	1	And, as he intended, they did.	0.6622292995452881
S044	18	2	And now, more than 20 states in our country have a Trump abortion ban.	0.6813538670539856
S044	18	3	Many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest.	0.6967036128044128
S044	18	4	And if he wins, we all know he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every state, even in Wisconsin.	0.6849545240402222
S044	19	0	So listen, everyone took time out of your busy lives, and days and all your obligations to come out here and to be together as one community.	0.6712870001792908
S044	19	1	And I know you did it also because we all know, listen, so much is on the line in this election.	0.6707427501678467
S044	19	2	It can’t be said seriously enough.	0.6836121082305908
S044	19	3	So much is on the line.	0.6729496121406555
S044	19	4	And compounded with everything else that we knew was on the line, think about the fact that last month the United States Supreme Court, basically, told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that going forward he will be immune, no matter what he does in the White House.	0.6729110479354858
S044	20	0	Think about what that means and the changed circumstances since 16/6/20 when you think about what that court decision means.	0.6771153807640076
S044	20	1	Donald Trump has openly vowed if re-elected, he will be a dictator on day one.	0.6987403035163879
S044	20	2	That he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies.	0.6761197447776794
S044	20	3	That he would round up peaceful protesters and throw them out of our country.	0.6831415891647339
S044	20	4	And even, “Terminate the United States Constitution.” So let us be clear, let us be clear, someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have a chance to stand behind the seal of the President of the United States.	0.6672879457473755
S044	20	5	So basically, I think it all comes down to this, we’re all here because we love our country.	0.6917446851730347
S044	20	6	We love our country.	0.6913241744041443
S044	20	7	We love our country.	0.6913241744041443
S044	20	8	And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country.	0.6659181118011475
S044	20	9	And that’s how we preserve the promise of America ’cause, after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible, by the way, for Governor Walz and me to stand on this stage today.	0.6764892339706421
S044	20	10	Just think about it, two middle-class kids one, a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother and had a summer job at McDonald’s.	0.6859896779060364
S044	20	11	The other, a son of the Nebraska Plains who grew up working on a farm.	0.6643738150596619
S044	20	12	Think about that.	0.6372443437576294
S044	20	13	Only in America is it possible for them, together, to make it all the way together to the White House.	0.672713577747345
S044	20	14	Only in America.	0.6589466333389282
S044	20	15	Only in America.	0.6589466333389282
S044	21	0	So this is a fight to make real the promise of America for every person in our nation.	0.6643071174621582
S044	21	1	And also I’ll tell you, and I promise you, our campaign’s going to reach out to everyone, from red states, from blue states, from the heartland to the coast.	0.6748870611190796
S044	21	2	We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans.	0.6680115461349487
S044	21	3	And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans because Coach Walz and I know, and we’re clear about this unlike the other side, we work for you.	0.6806907653808594
S044	21	4	We work for you, the American people.	0.6525015234947205
S044	21	5	And we will always fight for you, for your family, for your freedoms, and for your future.	0.6617138385772705
S044	22	0	So Wisconsin, ultimately, this election is about a question that we each face.	0.6702360510826111
S044	22	1	We each face a question in this election.	0.6618703007698059
S044	22	2	And that is, what kind of country do we want to live in?	0.6823585033416748
S044	22	3	Do we want to live in a country of freedom, of compassion, of rule of law?	0.667978823184967
S044	23	0	So in the next 90 days, we need you to use your power.	0.6787298321723938

S044	23	3	We need you to energize, and organize, and mobilize and make your voices heard.	0.6689457297325134
S044	24	0	And I’ll tell you about an hour ago after I landed on Air Force 2, I met a collection of young leaders from Girl Scout Troop 3307.	0.6866576671600342
S044	24	1	Oh, they were spectacular.	0.6790635585784912

S044	24	4	They all made just… They were spectacular.	0.6857512593269348
S044	24	5	And one of those young leaders had a shirt on that said, “You are powerful and your voice matters.” Right?	0.6815202236175537
S044	24	6	From the mouths of babes they’re telling us, they’re telling us.	0.669529139995575
S044	24	7	And so, let’s remember that.	0.6343346834182739

S044	44	1	And, as he intended, they did.	0.6622292995452881
