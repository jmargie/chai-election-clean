S007	0	9	I want to talk about Hurricane Helene for a moment, and I know that everyone here sends their thoughts and prayers for the folks who have been so devastated by that hurricane and the ensuing events in Florida, in Georgia, the Carolinas and other impacted states.	0.67131108045578

S007	1	16	I know we have some extraordinary elected leaders here and I want to thank them for their incredible work and friendship.	0.6941887736320496
S007	1	17	It is good to be with all the leaders who are here, including Representative Susie Lee, who is here, Steven Horsford, Dina Titus, the great General Ford, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Senator Jacky Rosen, who we’re going to send back to the United States Senate.	0.690710186958313
S007	1	18	Thank you, everyone and all the local leaders here.	0.6726511716842651
S007	1	19	There are so many leaders here.	0.6693571209907532
S007	1	20	It is good to be back with you.	0.712673544883728
S007	2	0	So Las Vegas, we have 37 days until the election, 37 days.	0.6668704748153687
S007	2	1	And we know this will be a tight race until the very end.	0.6638572812080383
S007	2	2	And let’s level set.	0.6166244149208069
S007	2	3	We are the underdog.	0.671168863773346
S007	2	4	We are the underdog, and we have some hard work ahead.	0.6776625514030457
S007	2	5	But here’s the thing, we like hard work.	0.6802540421485901
S007	2	6	Hard work is good work.	0.6626654863357544
S007	2	7	Hard work is good work.	0.6626654863357544
S007	2	8	And with your help, we will win in November.	0.6723268628120422
S007	2	9	Yes, we will.	0.6673502922058105
S007	2	10	Yes, we will.	0.6673502922058105
S007	2	11	Yes, we will.	0.6673502922058105
S007	2	12	We will win.	0.6583869457244873
S007	3	0	But listen, also, their debate should not be the last word.	0.6629303693771362
S007	3	1	I’m trying to debate Donald Trump again, and I think he should debate again.	0.7001675367355347
S007	3	2	The American people have a right to hear us discuss the issues.	0.6578475832939148
S007	3	3	And as you say here in Las Vegas, I’m all in.	0.6448290348052979
S007	3	4	I’m all in.	0.6344621181488037
S007	3	5	Even if my opponent is ready to fold.	0.6862112879753113
S007	3	6	So there you go.	0.628517746925354
S007	4	0	But you will remember in our first debate I talked about issues like bringing down the cost of living, investing in small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom and keeping our nation secure.	0.6644312739372253
S007	5	0	But from Donald Trump, well it was the same old, tired playbook, same old, tired playbook, with no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people.	0.6722836494445801
S007	5	1	Well folks, it’s time to turn the page.	0.6660640239715576
S007	5	2	Time to turn the page.	0.657010555267334
S007	6	0	America is ready to chart a new way forward, ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership, which is why Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are supporting our campaign because we know we need a president who works for all the American people.	0.6829511523246765
S007	6	1	Enough of the division.	0.6425396203994751
S007	6	2	Enough of the hate.	0.6576157212257385
S007	6	3	We are all in this together.	0.6613876819610596
S007	6	4	And you all know from my entire career, I’ve only had one client, the people, the people.	0.6826241612434387
S007	7	0	From being a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators.	0.679429829120636
S007	7	1	As Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure.	0.6689746975898743
S007	7	2	I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by for-profit colleges, for workers who are being cheated out of their wages.	0.6761801838874817
S007	7	3	And I pledge to you as president, I will fight for all Americans and together we will build a brighter future for our nation.	0.6743683218955994
S007	7	4	We will build a future that includes thinking about our economy in a way that it is about lifting everyone up.	0.6788197159767151
S007	7	5	We will build what I call an opportunity economy so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business.	0.6825783848762512
S007	8	0	And let me tell you, I love our small businesses, of which I’ve met so many right here in Vegas.	0.7050039768218994
S007	8	1	Growing up, our mother worked very long hours.	0.6637157797813416
S007	8	2	And so my sister Maya and I would go over two doors down to Ms.	0.682093620300293
S007	8	3	Shelton’s house.	0.6137371063232422
S007	8	4	We called her our second mother.	0.6645392775535583
S007	8	5	And Ms.	0.6374539732933044
S007	8	6	Shelton was a small business owner.	0.6654374003410339
S007	8	7	So I know since I was a young child who our small businesses are, who our small business owners are.	0.6820157766342163
S007	8	8	Small businesses are the backbone of America’s economy.	0.6634793281555176
S007	8	9	I know that.	0.660313069820404
S007	8	10	I know that.	0.660313069820404
S007	8	11	And Latina small business owners are the fastest growing segment of our economy.	0.6725238561630249
S007	9	0	So my plan is about tapping into that ambition, those aspirations, those dreams, those incredible ideas, that strong work ethic that people have.	0.6879616975784302
S007	9	1	Also understanding not everybody gets handed $4 million on a silver platter and files for bankruptcy six times.	0.6977362036705017
S007	10	0	So my plan is about saying we’ve got to help entrepreneurs, startups out.	0.6805875301361084
S007	10	1	And I will give a $50,000 tax deduction to help entrepreneurs start their small businesses.	0.6902289390563965
S007	10	2	Because right now that tax deduction is $5,000.	0.6911101937294006
S007	10	3	Can’t nobody start a small business in 2024.	0.6650293469429016
S007	10	4	So we are going to make it something where it is doable to lift folks up.	0.6813527345657349
S007	10	5	We also need to build more housing in America.	0.6575586199760437
S007	11	0	My mother saved up for years till I was a teenager when she was able to buy our first home.	0.6914802193641663
S007	11	1	And right now a serious housing shortage is part of what is driving up cost.	0.6708120107650757
S007	11	2	So we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes and provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 down payment assistance so you can just get your foot in the door.	0.6724489331245422
S007	11	3	You’ll do the rest.	0.6204333901405334
S007	12	0	And we must lower the cost of living because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high.	0.67757648229599
S007	12	1	You know it and I know it.	0.6697150468826294
S007	12	2	So I have a plan that includes lowering costs on everything from healthcare to groceries, including I will take on the corporate	0.6878232955932617
S007	13	0	And in two days, I know we will cheer on Coach Walz when he debates JD Vance.	0.6814281940460205
S007	13	1	Yeah.	0.6193130612373352
S007	14	0	And so as president, part of how I’m going to push this forward is I will get rid of unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs, understanding that having a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a worker.	0.6899130940437317
S007	14	1	And when we do that with the federal workforce, I’m coming to ask the private sector to challenge you to do the same.	0.6738986372947693
S007	14	2	So all of this is the same.	0.6460825800895691
S007	14	3	I will always put the middle class and working families first.	0.6611260771751404
S007	14	4	I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from.	0.7068365216255188
S007	14	5	Now Donald Trump has a different plan.	0.6680482029914856
S007	14	6	Just Google Project 2025, which I have to say I still can’t believe they put that thing in writing.	0.7122538685798645
S007	14	7	They printed it up, they bound it, they handed it out.	0.6673370003700256
S007	15	0	Just Google it.	0.6892814636230469
S007	15	1	It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he would do if he were elected again, as president.	0.672998309135437
S007	15	2	Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive cuts again, cut Social security and Medicare, and impose what I call a Trump sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday basic necessities, which economists have measured would cost the average family nearly 4,000 more dollars a year in everyday expenses.	0.6776062846183777
S007	15	3	And on top of all this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act, and he has no plan to replace it.	0.6696196794509888
S007	15	4	He has “concepts of a plan,” concepts.	0.6685270667076111
S007	16	0	So here’s the thing though.	0.6017918586730957
S007	16	1	We can laugh about many things, but the consequences of this are quite serious, quite serious.	0.7055341005325317
S007	16	2	Because think about it.	0.6511139273643494
S007	16	3	He’s going to threaten health coverage and health insurance for 45 million people in our country based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions?	0.6833836436271667
S007	16	4	You remember what that was like?	0.6839280128479004
S007	16	5	Well, we are not going back.	0.6773039698600769
S007	16	6	We are not going back.	0.664142370223999
S007	16	7	We’re not going back.	0.6375125646591187
S007	16	8	We’re not going back.	0.6375125646591187
S007	16	9	We will move forward, and we’ll take on the biggest issues facing our nation.	0.6651264429092407
S007	16	10	We have talked about the economy.	0.6638169288635254
S007	16	11	We have talked about what we can do in terms of investing in the ambition, the aspirations of our country.	0.658219039440155
S007	16	12	We will take on the issue of immigration.	0.658580482006073
S007	16	13	We will take on a number of issues on the subject of immigration.	0.6599805951118469
S007	16	14	We must have comprehensive immigration reform with strong border of security and an earned pathway to citizenship, including for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years, including our dreamers, including our dreamers.	0.6802480220794678
S007	16	15	And I was Attorney General of a border state.	0.6811730265617371
S007	17	0	I prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings.	0.6895788908004761
S007	17	1	And as president, I will double the resources for the Department of Justice to go after those transnational cartels and take action to stop the flow of fentanyl coming into our country, which is destroying entire communities.	0.6713350415229797
S007	17	2	These are serious problems, and we know Donald Trump won’t solve them.	0.6769054532051086
S007	17	3	When he was president, he did nothing to fix our immigration system.	0.654123067855835
S007	17	4	And earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan board of security bill in decades, and Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought that that bill, if passed, would’ve hurt him and he’d prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.	0.6798895001411438
S007	17	5	That’s not the kind of president we want.	0.6634393334388733
S007	17	6	As president, he cruelly separated families and plans to do it again.	0.6879825592041016
S007	17	7	And he continues to fan the flames of fear and division.	0.6974363327026367
S007	17	8	Look, we need a president who cares more about solving problems than playing political games and demeaning people full-time.	0.6871258020401001
S007	17	9	I’m tired of that.	0.6601702570915222
S007	17	10	We’re done with that.	0.6143649816513062
S007	17	11	So Nevada, ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.	0.6796271204948425
S007	17	12	And we remember how we got here.	0.6723965406417847
S007	17	13	Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court, the court of Thurgood and RBG, so that they would do as they did and overturn the protections of Roe V.	0.6806369423866272
S007	17	14	Wade.	0.630521833896637
S007	17	15	And now, one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest.	0.6935920119285583
S007	17	16	It is immoral, immoral.	0.6881772875785828
S007	17	17	And let us agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn’t be telling her what to do.	0.6697778701782227
S007	17	18	If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government telling her what to do with	0.6766127347946167
S007	18	0	… price gouging that we know has resulted in jacking prices up, often around tragedies and emergencies.	0.6914450526237488
S007	18	1	We will give a tax cut to a hundred million more Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child’s life, knowing that the vast majority of our young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources to do it.	0.6856074333190918
S007	18	2	And that $6,000 in extending and expanding the child tax credit will help buying a crib, buying a car seat, doing the things that are so critical in that first phase of life.	0.6898161172866821
S007	18	3	I will also make sure good paying jobs are available to all Americans, not only those with college degrees, because we need to recognize the value of additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs.	0.6844592094421387
S007	19	0	Look, generations before us, generations of America led the fight for freedom, and the baton, well, it’s now in our hands.	0.6665900349617004
S007	19	1	It’s now in our hands.	0.6291787028312683
S007	19	2	And it all comes down to this, we are here together.	0.6632152795791626
S007	19	3	You came out on a Sunday evening.	0.6624625325202942
S007	19	4	We are here together because we know what is at stake and we are here together because we love our country.	0.682070791721344
S007	19	5	We love our country.	0.6913241744041443
S007	19	6	We love our country.	0.6913241744041443
S007	20	0	And remember, your vote is your voice.	0.6629406213760376
S007	20	1	Your voice is your power.	0.6683259606361389
S007	20	2	Don’t ever let anybody take your power from you.	0.6730511784553528
S007	20	3	Never.	0.6132462024688721
S007	20	4	Never.	0.6132462024688721
S007	20	5	Don’t let anybody silence you ever.	0.6586410403251648
S007	21	0	Thank you, thank you, thank you.	0.7027841806411743
S007	21	1	And wait a minute, we also tonight have here some of the Vegas Raiders, who won their game tonight.	0.6844344735145569
S007	21	2	Congratulations.	0.6953211426734924
S007	21	3	Oh, congratulations.	0.7004005908966064
S007	21	4	You came right from the game.	0.6653163433074951
S007	21	5	Congratulations.	0.6953211426734924
S007	21	6	Give them a big applause, right?	0.6751551032066345
S007	21	7	Well done, well done.	0.6736081838607788
S007	21	8	So in all seriousness, everyone, before I begin, I want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene, and please have a seat if you’re able.	0.6722368597984314
S007	21	9	I want to talk about Hurricane Helene for a moment, and I know that everyone here sends their thoughts and prayers for the folks who have been so devastated by that hurricane and the ensuing events in Florida, in Georgia, the Carolinas and other impacted states.	0.67131108045578
S007	21	10	And we know that so many have been impacted, some have died.	0.678992748260498

S007	22	17	It is good to be with all the leaders who are here, including Representative Susie Lee, who is here, Steven Horsford, Dina Titus, the great General Ford, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Senator Jacky Rosen, who we’re going to send back to the United States Senate.	0.690710186958313
S007	22	18	Thank you, everyone and all the local leaders here.	0.6726511716842651
S007	22	19	There are so many leaders here.	0.6693571209907532
S007	22	20	It is good to be back with you.	0.712673544883728
S007	23	0	So Las Vegas, we have 37 days until the election, 37 days.	0.6668704748153687
S007	23	1	And we know this will be a tight race until the very end.	0.6638572812080383
S007	23	2	And let’s level set.	0.6166244149208069
S007	23	3	We are the underdog.	0.671168863773346
S007	23	4	We are the underdog, and we have some hard work ahead.	0.6776625514030457
S007	23	5	But here’s the thing, we like hard work.	0.6802540421485901
S007	23	6	Hard work is good work.	0.6626654863357544
S007	23	7	Hard work is good work.	0.6626654863357544
S007	23	8	And with your help, we will win in November.	0.6723268628120422
S007	23	9	Yes, we will.	0.6673502922058105
S007	23	10	Yes, we will.	0.6673502922058105
S007	23	11	Yes, we will.	0.6673502922058105
S007	23	12	We will win.	0.6583869457244873
S007	24	0	But listen, also, their debate should not be the last word.	0.6629303693771362
S007	24	1	I’m trying to debate Donald Trump again, and I think he should debate again.	0.7001675367355347
S007	24	2	The American people have a right to hear us discuss the issues.	0.6578475832939148
S007	24	3	And as you say here in Las Vegas, I’m all in.	0.6448290348052979
S007	24	4	I’m all in.	0.6344621181488037
S007	24	5	Even if my opponent is ready to fold.	0.6862112879753113
S007	24	6	So there you go.	0.628517746925354
S007	25	0	But you will remember in our first debate I talked about issues like bringing down the cost of living, investing in small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom and keeping our nation secure.	0.6644312739372253
S007	26	0	But from Donald Trump, well it was the same old, tired playbook, same old, tired playbook, with no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people.	0.6722836494445801
S007	26	1	Well folks, it’s time to turn the page.	0.6660640239715576
S007	26	2	Time to turn the page.	0.657010555267334
S007	27	0	America is ready to chart a new way forward, ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership, which is why Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are supporting our campaign because we know we need a president who works for all the American people.	0.6829511523246765
S007	27	1	Enough of the division.	0.6425396203994751
S007	27	2	Enough of the hate.	0.6576157212257385
S007	27	3	We are all in this together.	0.6613876819610596
S007	27	4	And you all know from my entire career, I’ve only had one client, the people, the people.	0.6826241612434387
S007	28	0	From being a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators.	0.679429829120636
S007	28	1	As Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure.	0.6689746975898743
S007	28	2	I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by for-profit colleges, for workers who are being cheated out of their wages.	0.6761801838874817
S007	28	3	And I pledge to you as president, I will fight for all Americans and together we will build a brighter future for our nation.	0.6743683218955994
S007	28	4	We will build a future that includes thinking about our economy in a way that it is about lifting everyone up.	0.6788197159767151
S007	28	5	We will build what I call an opportunity economy so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business.	0.6825783848762512
S007	29	0	And let me tell you, I love our small businesses, of which I’ve met so many right here in Vegas.	0.7050039768218994
S007	29	1	Growing up, our mother worked very long hours.	0.6637157797813416
S007	29	2	And so my sister Maya and I would go over two doors down to Ms.	0.682093620300293
S007	29	3	Shelton’s house.	0.6137371063232422
S007	29	4	We called her our second mother.	0.6645392775535583
S007	29	5	And Ms.	0.6374539732933044
S007	29	6	Shelton was a small business owner.	0.6654374003410339
S007	29	7	So I know since I was a young child who our small businesses are, who our small business owners are.	0.6820157766342163
S007	29	8	Small businesses are the backbone of America’s economy.	0.6634793281555176
S007	29	9	I know that.	0.660313069820404
S007	29	10	I know that.	0.660313069820404
S007	29	11	And Latina small business owners are the fastest growing segment of our economy.	0.6725238561630249
S007	30	0	So my plan is about tapping into that ambition, those aspirations, those dreams, those incredible ideas, that strong work ethic that people have.	0.6879616975784302
S007	30	1	Also understanding not everybody gets handed $4 million on a silver platter and files for bankruptcy six times.	0.6977362036705017
S007	31	0	So my plan is about saying we’ve got to help entrepreneurs, startups out.	0.6805875301361084
S007	31	1	And I will give a $50,000 tax deduction to help entrepreneurs start their small businesses.	0.6902289390563965
S007	31	2	Because right now that tax deduction is $5,000.	0.6911101937294006
S007	31	3	Can’t nobody start a small business in 2024.	0.6650293469429016
S007	31	4	So we are going to make it something where it is doable to lift folks up.	0.6813527345657349
S007	31	5	We also need to build more housing in America.	0.6575586199760437
S007	32	0	My mother saved up for years till I was a teenager when she was able to buy our first home.	0.6914802193641663
S007	32	1	And right now a serious housing shortage is part of what is driving up cost.	0.6708120107650757
S007	32	2	So we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes and provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 down payment assistance so you can just get your foot in the door.	0.6724489331245422
S007	32	3	You’ll do the rest.	0.6204333901405334
S007	33	0	And we must lower the cost of living because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high.	0.67757648229599
S007	33	1	You know it and I know it.	0.6697150468826294
S007	33	2	So I have a plan that includes lowering costs on everything from healthcare to groceries, including I will take on the corporate	0.6878232955932617
S007	34	0	And in two days, I know we will cheer on Coach Walz when he debates JD Vance.	0.6814281940460205
S007	34	1	Yeah.	0.6193130612373352
S007	35	0	And so as president, part of how I’m going to push this forward is I will get rid of unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs, understanding that having a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a worker.	0.6899130940437317
S007	35	1	And when we do that with the federal workforce, I’m coming to ask the private sector to challenge you to do the same.	0.6738986372947693
S007	35	2	So all of this is the same.	0.6460825800895691
S007	35	3	I will always put the middle class and working families first.	0.6611260771751404
S007	35	4	I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from.	0.7068365216255188
S007	35	5	Now Donald Trump has a different plan.	0.6680482029914856
S007	35	6	Just Google Project 2025, which I have to say I still can’t believe they put that thing in writing.	0.7122538685798645
S007	35	7	They printed it up, they bound it, they handed it out.	0.6673370003700256
S007	36	0	Just Google it.	0.6892814636230469
S007	36	1	It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he would do if he were elected again, as president.	0.672998309135437
S007	36	2	Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive cuts again, cut Social security and Medicare, and impose what I call a Trump sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday basic necessities, which economists have measured would cost the average family nearly 4,000 more dollars a year in everyday expenses.	0.6776062846183777
S007	36	3	And on top of all this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act, and he has no plan to replace it.	0.6696196794509888
S007	36	4	He has “concepts of a plan,” concepts.	0.6685270667076111
S007	37	0	So here’s the thing though.	0.6017918586730957
S007	37	1	We can laugh about many things, but the consequences of this are quite serious, quite serious.	0.7055341005325317
S007	37	2	Because think about it.	0.6511139273643494
S007	37	3	He’s going to threaten health coverage and health insurance for 45 million people in our country based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions?	0.6833836436271667
S007	37	4	You remember what that was like?	0.6839280128479004
S007	37	5	Well, we are not going back.	0.6773039698600769
S007	37	6	We are not going back.	0.664142370223999
S007	37	7	We’re not going back.	0.6375125646591187
S007	37	8	We’re not going back.	0.6375125646591187
S007	37	9	We will move forward, and we’ll take on the biggest issues facing our nation.	0.6651264429092407
S007	37	10	We have talked about the economy.	0.6638169288635254
S007	37	11	We have talked about what we can do in terms of investing in the ambition, the aspirations of our country.	0.658219039440155
S007	37	12	We will take on the issue of immigration.	0.658580482006073
S007	37	13	We will take on a number of issues on the subject of immigration.	0.6599805951118469
S007	37	14	We must have comprehensive immigration reform with strong border of security and an earned pathway to citizenship, including for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years, including our dreamers, including our dreamers.	0.6802480220794678
S007	37	15	And I was Attorney General of a border state.	0.6811730265617371
S007	38	0	I prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings.	0.6895788908004761
S007	38	1	And as president, I will double the resources for the Department of Justice to go after those transnational cartels and take action to stop the flow of fentanyl coming into our country, which is destroying entire communities.	0.6713350415229797
S007	38	2	These are serious problems, and we know Donald Trump won’t solve them.	0.6769054532051086
S007	38	3	When he was president, he did nothing to fix our immigration system.	0.654123067855835
S007	38	4	And earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan board of security bill in decades, and Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought that that bill, if passed, would’ve hurt him and he’d prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.	0.6798895001411438
S007	38	5	That’s not the kind of president we want.	0.6634393334388733
S007	38	6	As president, he cruelly separated families and plans to do it again.	0.6879825592041016
S007	38	7	And he continues to fan the flames of fear and division.	0.6974363327026367
S007	38	8	Look, we need a president who cares more about solving problems than playing political games and demeaning people full-time.	0.6871258020401001
S007	38	9	I’m tired of that.	0.6601702570915222
S007	38	10	We’re done with that.	0.6143649816513062
S007	38	11	So Nevada, ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.	0.6796271204948425
S007	38	12	And we remember how we got here.	0.6723965406417847
S007	38	13	Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court, the court of Thurgood and RBG, so that they would do as they did and overturn the protections of Roe V.	0.6806369423866272
S007	38	14	Wade.	0.630521833896637
S007	38	15	And now, one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest.	0.6935920119285583
S007	38	16	It is immoral, immoral.	0.6881772875785828
S007	38	17	And let us agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn’t be telling her what to do.	0.6697778701782227
S007	38	18	If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government telling her what to do with	0.6766127347946167
S007	39	0	… price gouging that we know has resulted in jacking prices up, often around tragedies and emergencies.	0.6914450526237488
S007	39	1	We will give a tax cut to a hundred million more Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child’s life, knowing that the vast majority of our young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources to do it.	0.6856074333190918
S007	39	2	And that $6,000 in extending and expanding the child tax credit will help buying a crib, buying a car seat, doing the things that are so critical in that first phase of life.	0.6898161172866821
S007	39	3	I will also make sure good paying jobs are available to all Americans, not only those with college degrees, because we need to recognize the value of additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs.	0.6844592094421387
S007	40	0	Look, generations before us, generations of America led the fight for freedom, and the baton, well, it’s now in our hands.	0.6665900349617004
S007	40	1	It’s now in our hands.	0.6291787028312683
S007	40	2	And it all comes down to this, we are here together.	0.6632152795791626
S007	40	3	You came out on a Sunday evening.	0.6624625325202942
S007	40	4	We are here together because we know what is at stake and we are here together because we love our country.	0.682070791721344
S007	40	5	We love our country.	0.6913241744041443
S007	40	6	We love our country.	0.6913241744041443
S007	41	0	And remember, your vote is your voice.	0.6629406213760376
S007	41	1	Your voice is your power.	0.6683259606361389
