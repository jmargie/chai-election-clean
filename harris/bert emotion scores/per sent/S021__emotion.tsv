S021	0	0	So thank you all.	0.6929308176040649
S021	0	1	So listen, this election, I do strongly believe is about two very different visions for our nation.	0.6676291227340698
S021	0	2	One, ours.	0.657976508140564
S021	0	3	Focused on the future, and the other focused on the past.	0.6711466312408447
S021	0	4	We see that contrast clearly in many ways, including when it comes to how we think about the economy.	0.671065628528595
S021	0	5	So our country has come a long way since President Biden and I took office.	0.6739333868026733
S021	0	6	At that time, we sadly remembered the millions of Americans that were out of work.	0.6603400707244873
S021	0	7	We were facing one of the worst economic crises in modern history.	0.6880109906196594
S021	0	8	And today, by virtually every measure, our economy is the strongest in the world.	0.6970483660697937
S021	1	0	We have created 16 million new jobs.	0.6817825436592102
S021	1	1	We have made historic investments in infrastructure, in chips manufacturing, in clean energy, and new numbers this week alone show that inflation is down under 3%.	0.6800889372825623
S021	1	2	And as President of the United States, it will be my intention to build on the foundation of this progress.	0.6639204025268555
S021	1	3	Still, we know that many Americans don’t yet feel that progress in their daily lives.	0.6773681044578552
S021	1	4	Costs are still too high, and on a deeper level for too many people, no matter how much they work, it feels so hard to just be able to get ahead.	0.6979857087135315
S021	2	0	As President, I will be laser focused on creating opportunities for the middle class that advance their economic security, stability and dignity.	0.6735906600952148
S021	2	1	Together, we will build what I call an opportunity economy, an opportunity economy, an economy where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed.	0.6848137378692627
S021	2	2	Everyone, regardless of who they are or where they start, has an opportunity to build wealth for themselves and their children.	0.6878823637962341
S021	2	3	And where we remove the barriers to opportunity, so anyone who wants to start a business or advance their career can access the tools and the resources that are necessary to do so.	0.6788162589073181
S021	3	0	I will focus on cutting needless bureaucracy and unnecessary regulatory red tape and encouraging innovative technologies while protecting consumers and creating a stable business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road.	0.6692632436752319
S021	3	1	As President, I will bring together labor with small businesses and major companies to invest in America, to create good jobs, achieve broad-based growth, and ensure that America continues to define the future and lead the world.	0.6776034832000732
S021	4	0	And key, key, to creating this opportunity economy is building up our middle class.	0.6683865785598755
S021	4	1	It is essential.	0.6400991082191467
S021	4	2	The middle class is one of America’s greatest strengths, and to protect it, then, we must defend basic principles, such as your salary should be enough to provide you and your family with a good quality of life, such as no child should have to grow up in poverty, such as after years of hard work, you should be able to retire with dignity, and you should be able to join a union if you choose.	0.6870853900909424
S021	4	3	Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency because I strongly believe when the middle class is strong, America is strong.	0.682707667350769
S021	5	0	So in the weeks to come, I will address in greater detail my plans to build an opportunity economy, and today, I will focus on one element that’s on the minds of many Americans as they pay their bills at the kitchen table or walk the aisles of a grocery store, and that is lowering the cost of living.	0.6827937960624695
S021	5	1	So every day across our nation, families talk about their plans for the future, their ambitions, their aspirations for themselves, for their children, and they talk about how they’re going to be able to actually achieve them financially.	0.6874255537986755
S021	5	2	Because look, the bills add up, food, rent, gas, back-to-school clothes, prescription medication.	0.681729257106781
S021	5	3	After all that, for many families, there’s not much left at the end of the month.	0.6846892833709717
S021	6	0	I grew up in a middle-class household.	0.6777892112731934
S021	6	1	For most of my childhood, we were renters.	0.6854305267333984
S021	6	2	My mother saved for well over a decade to buy a home.	0.6777254343032837
S021	6	3	I was a teenager when that day finally came, and I can remember so well how excited she was.	0.6989125609397888
S021	6	4	I kind of understood what it meant, but we called her mommy, mommy was so excited.	0.704270601272583
S021	6	5	It just made us excited that she was so excited.	0.7128998041152954
S021	6	6	Later in college, I worked at McDonald’s to earn spending money.	0.7004899978637695
S021	6	7	Well, some of the people I worked with were raising families on that paycheck.	0.6776661276817322
S021	6	8	They worked second or even third jobs to pay rent and buy food.	0.6796391606330872
S021	6	9	That only gets harder when the cost of living goes up.	0.6981966495513916
S021	7	0	When I am elected President, I will make it a top priority to bring cost and increase economic security for all Americans.	0.6774756908416748
S021	7	1	As President, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food.	0.6748723983764648
S021	7	2	We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed, but our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high.	0.6825473308563232
S021	7	3	A loaf of bread cost 50% more today than it did before the pandemic.	0.6825184226036072
S021	7	4	Ground beef is up almost 50%.	0.6979399919509888
S021	7	5	Many of the big food companies are seeing their highest profits in two decades, and while many grocery chains pass along these savings, others still aren’t.	0.6915777921676636
S021	8	0	Look, I know most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy, and playing by the rules, but some are not, and that’s just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case.	0.6686534285545349
S021	8	1	As Attorney General in California, I went after companies that illegally increased prices, including wholesalers that inflated the price of prescription medication and companies that conspired with competitors to keep prices of electronics high.	0.6863559484481812
S021	8	2	I won more than $1 billion for consumers.	0.7030677199363708
S021	8	3	So believe me, as President, I will go after the bad actors, and I will work to pass the first ever federal ban on price gauging on food.	0.6912798881530762
S021	8	4	My plan will include new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules, and we will support smaller food businesses that are trying to play by the rules and get ahead.	0.681817889213562
S021	8	5	We’ll help the food industry become more competitive, because I believe competition is the lifeblood of our economy.	0.6789650917053223
S021	8	6	More competition means lower prices for you and your families.	0.6817337274551392
S021	9	0	Now, compare what Donald Trump plans to do.	0.6608573794364929
S021	9	1	He wants to impose what is in effect a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries.	0.67116779088974
S021	9	2	That will devastate Americans.	0.6930975317955017
S021	9	3	It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs.	0.6845695376396179
S021	9	4	A Trump tax on gas, a Trump tax on food, a Trump tax on clothing, a Trump tax on over-the-counter medication.	0.6772486567497253
S021	9	5	And economists have done the math.	0.66717129945755
S021	9	6	Donald Trump’s plan would cost a typical family $3,900 a year.	0.6690002083778381
S021	9	7	At this moment, when everyday prices are too high, he will make them even higher.	0.6952680349349976
S021	10	0	As President, I’ll attack and take on the issue of the cost of healthcare.	0.6774042248725891
S021	10	1	As Attorney General, I took on insurance companies and Big Pharma and got them to lower their prices.	0.6797063946723938
S021	10	2	And together with President Biden, we’ve gone even further.	0.6771624088287354
S021	10	3	We capped the price of insulin at $35 a month and the total cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year for seniors.	0.6902087926864624
S021	10	4	We let Medicare negotiate lower drug prices for seniors.	0.683941125869751
S021	10	5	And just yesterday, we announced that we are lowering the price by up to 80% for 10 more life-saving drugs.	0.6936280131340027
S021	11	0	And I pledge to continue this progress.	0.6713301539421082
S021	11	1	I’ll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone with your support, not only our seniors, and demand transparency from the middlemen who operate between Big Pharma and the insurance companies who use opaque practices to raise your drug prices and profit off your need for medicine.	0.6752699613571167
S021	11	2	Two months ago, I announced that medical debt will no longer be used against your credit score, and I will work as President with states, like here in North Carolina, Roy Cooper, thank you again, to cancel medical debt for more and more, millions more Americans.	0.6996806263923645
S021	12	0	As for Donald Trump, well, he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which 45 million Americans rely on, 45 million Americans rely on it for healthcare.	0.6542987823486328
S021	12	1	That would take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions.	0.6671225428581238
S021	12	2	We all remember what that was, and we’re not going back.	0.677509069442749
S021	13	0	And let’s talk about the cost of housing.	0.6483814120292664
S021	13	1	So now, the housing market can be complicated, but look, I’m not new to this issue.	0.7003214955329895
S021	13	2	As State Attorney General, I drafted and helped pass a Homeowner Bill of Rights, one of the first in America.	0.6746745705604553
S021	13	3	And during the foreclosure crisis, I took on the big banks for predatory lending with many of my colleagues, including Roy Cooper, and won $20 billion for California families when I was Attorney General.	0.6831105351448059
S021	13	4	So I know how to fight for people who are being exploited in the housing market, and I know what homeownership means.	0.6892917156219482
S021	13	5	It’s more than a financial transaction.	0.6562603116035461
S021	13	6	It’s so much more than that.	0.6711574196815491
S021	13	7	It’s more than a house.	0.6442957520484924
S021	13	8	Homeownership and what that means, it’s a symbol of the pride that comes with hard work.	0.6917068958282471
S021	13	9	It’s financial security.	0.6240456104278564
S021	13	10	It represents what you will be able to do for your children.	0.6800499558448792
S021	14	0	And sadly, right now, it is out of reach for far too many American families.	0.6728587746620178
S021	14	1	There’s a serious housing shortage in many places.	0.669797420501709
S021	14	2	It’s too difficult to build, and it’s driving prices up.	0.6781450510025024
S021	14	3	As President, I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing we need, both to rent and to buy.	0.6755104660987854
S021	14	4	We will take down barriers and cut red tape, including at the state and local levels.	0.6717954277992249
S021	14	5	And by the end of my first term, we will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class.	0.6821421980857849
S021	14	6	And we’ll do that together.	0.6542681455612183
S021	14	7	We’ll do that together.	0.6521011590957642
S021	15	0	And we will make sure those homes actually go to working and middle-class Americans, not just investors.	0.6651719212532043
S021	15	1	Because some corporate landlords, some of them buy dozens if not hundreds of houses and apartments.	0.6933297514915466
S021	15	2	Then, they turn them around and rent them out at extremely high prices, and it can make it impossible then for regular people to be able to buy or even rent a home.	0.7019644975662231
S021	15	3	Some corporate landlords collude with each other to set artificially high rental prices, often using algorithms in price-fixing software to do it.	0.6984682083129883
S021	15	4	It’s anticompetitive, and it drives up costs.	0.6693624258041382
S021	15	5	I will fight for a law that cracks down on these practices.	0.6919363141059875
S021	16	0	We also know that as the price of housing has gone up, the size of down payments have gone up as well.	0.6534076929092407
S021	16	1	Even if aspiring homeowners save for years, it often still is not enough.	0.6879215836524963
S021	16	2	So in addition, while we work on the housing shortage, my administration will provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 to help with the down payment on a new home.	0.6799261569976807
S021	16	3	We can do this, we can do this.	0.6699602007865906
S021	16	4	All to help more Americans experience the pride of homeownership and the financial security that it represents and brings.	0.6792786121368408
S021	17	0	So that’s my plan, but here’s what Donald Trump would do.	0.6650510430335999
S021	17	1	If his Project 2025 agenda is put into effect, it will add around $1,200 a year to the typical American mortgage.	0.6629152894020081
S021	17	2	He’s got it backward.	0.66953045129776
S021	17	3	We should be doing everything we can to make it more affordable to buy a home, not less.	0.6876733303070068
S021	18	0	Finally, there’s one more way I will help families deal with rising cost, and that’s by letting you keep more of your hard-earned money.	0.695838987827301
S021	18	1	Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut, and we will do this by restoring two tax cuts designed to help middle-class and working Americans, the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, through which millions of Americans with children got to keep more of their hard-earned income.	0.6821271777153015
S021	18	2	We know this works and has a direct impact on so many issues, including child poverty.	0.6781042814254761
S021	18	3	We know it works.	0.6500748991966248
S021	18	4	So as President, I’ll not only restore that tax cut but expand it.	0.6879337430000305
S021	18	5	We will provide $6,000 in tax relief to families during the first year of a child’s life.	0.6845919489860535
S021	19	0	Now, think what that means.	0.6718393564224243
S021	19	1	Think what that means.	0.6601616144180298
S021	19	2	That is a vital, vital year of critical development of a child, and the cost can really add up, especially for young parents who need to buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else.	0.6850133538246155
S021	19	3	And we will do this while reducing the deficit.	0.6665237545967102
S021	19	4	Compare my plan with what Donald Trump intends to do.	0.6675131916999817
S021	19	5	He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts, year after year, and he plans to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars even as they pull in record profits.	0.667975127696991
S021	19	6	And that’s on top of the $2 trillion tax cut he already signed into law when he was President, which by the way, overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly, went to the wealthiest Americans and corporations and exploded the national deficit.	0.6713378429412842
S021	19	7	I think that if you want to know who someone cares about, look who they fight for.	0.6717498302459717
S021	19	8	Look who they fight for.	0.6466835141181946
S021	19	9	Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations.	0.6710809469223022
S021	19	10	We, I will fight to give money back to working and middle-class Americans.	0.6700676679611206
S021	20	0	So I’ll end with this.	0.6314476728439331
S021	20	1	Two days ago, Donald Trump was here in North Carolina.	0.667985737323761
S021	20	2	He said he was going to talk about the economy.	0.6560567617416382
S021	20	3	I think you all watched, you know what I’m about to say.	0.6670877933502197
S021	20	4	But he offered no serious plans to reduce cost for middle-class families, no plan to expand access to housing or healthcare.	0.6534017324447632
S021	20	5	And that, actually, I think for most of us was not surprising because we already know his plans.	0.6811231970787048
S021	20	6	We know the Project 2025 agenda.	0.6565422415733337
S021	20	7	So there’s a choice in this election.	0.6528406739234924
S021	20	8	Donald Trump’s plans to devastate the middle class, punish working people, and make the cost of living go up for millions of Americans, and on the other hand, when I’m elected President, what we will do to bring down costs, increase the security and stability financially of your family, and expand opportunity for working and middle-class Americans.	0.6625788807868958
S021	21	0	So now, now, now is the time to chart a new way forward.	0.6570285558700562
S021	21	1	Now is the time to chart a new way forward, to build …	0.6711487174034119
S021	22	0	To build an America where everyone’s work is rewarded and talents are valued, where we work with labor and business to strengthen the American economy, and where everyone has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead.	0.6911661028862
S021	22	1	So I thank you, North Carolina.	0.6958604454994202
S021	22	2	We’re going to get this done, and with your help, God bless you and God bless the United States of America.	0.6870830059051514
S021	22	3	God bless you.	0.6961583495140076
S021	23	0	So thank you all.	0.6929308176040649
S021	23	1	So listen, this election, I do strongly believe is about two very different visions for our nation.	0.6676291227340698
S021	23	2	One, ours.	0.657976508140564
S021	23	3	Focused on the future, and the other focused on the past.	0.6711466312408447
S021	23	4	We see that contrast clearly in many ways, including when it comes to how we think about the economy.	0.671065628528595
S021	23	5	So our country has come a long way since President Biden and I took office.	0.6739333868026733
S021	23	6	At that time, we sadly remembered the millions of Americans that were out of work.	0.6603400707244873
S021	23	7	We were facing one of the worst economic crises in modern history.	0.6880109906196594
S021	23	8	And today, by virtually every measure, our economy is the strongest in the world.	0.6970483660697937
S021	24	0	We have created 16 million new jobs.	0.6817825436592102
S021	24	1	We have made historic investments in infrastructure, in chips manufacturing, in clean energy, and new numbers this week alone show that inflation is down under 3%.	0.6800889372825623
S021	24	2	And as President of the United States, it will be my intention to build on the foundation of this progress.	0.6639204025268555
S021	24	3	Still, we know that many Americans don’t yet feel that progress in their daily lives.	0.6773681044578552
S021	24	4	Costs are still too high, and on a deeper level for too many people, no matter how much they work, it feels so hard to just be able to get ahead.	0.6979857087135315
S021	25	0	As President, I will be laser focused on creating opportunities for the middle class that advance their economic security, stability and dignity.	0.6735906600952148
S021	25	1	Together, we will build what I call an opportunity economy, an opportunity economy, an economy where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed.	0.6848137378692627
S021	25	2	Everyone, regardless of who they are or where they start, has an opportunity to build wealth for themselves and their children.	0.6878823637962341
S021	25	3	And where we remove the barriers to opportunity, so anyone who wants to start a business or advance their career can access the tools and the resources that are necessary to do so.	0.6788162589073181
S021	26	0	I will focus on cutting needless bureaucracy and unnecessary regulatory red tape and encouraging innovative technologies while protecting consumers and creating a stable business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road.	0.6692632436752319
S021	26	1	As President, I will bring together labor with small businesses and major companies to invest in America, to create good jobs, achieve broad-based growth, and ensure that America continues to define the future and lead the world.	0.6776034832000732
S021	27	0	And key, key, to creating this opportunity economy is building up our middle class.	0.6683865785598755
S021	27	1	It is essential.	0.6400991082191467
S021	27	2	The middle class is one of America’s greatest strengths, and to protect it, then, we must defend basic principles, such as your salary should be enough to provide you and your family with a good quality of life, such as no child should have to grow up in poverty, such as after years of hard work, you should be able to retire with dignity, and you should be able to join a union if you choose.	0.6870853900909424
S021	27	3	Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency because I strongly believe when the middle class is strong, America is strong.	0.682707667350769
S021	28	0	So in the weeks to come, I will address in greater detail my plans to build an opportunity economy, and today, I will focus on one element that’s on the minds of many Americans as they pay their bills at the kitchen table or walk the aisles of a grocery store, and that is lowering the cost of living.	0.6827937960624695
S021	28	1	So every day across our nation, families talk about their plans for the future, their ambitions, their aspirations for themselves, for their children, and they talk about how they’re going to be able to actually achieve them financially.	0.6874255537986755
S021	28	2	Because look, the bills add up, food, rent, gas, back-to-school clothes, prescription medication.	0.681729257106781

S021	29	4	I kind of understood what it meant, but we called her mommy, mommy was so excited.	0.704270601272583
S021	29	5	It just made us excited that she was so excited.	0.7128998041152954
S021	29	6	Later in college, I worked at McDonald’s to earn spending money.	0.7004899978637695
S021	29	7	Well, some of the people I worked with were raising families on that paycheck.	0.6776661276817322
S021	29	8	They worked second or even third jobs to pay rent and buy food.	0.6796391606330872
S021	29	9	That only gets harder when the cost of living goes up.	0.6981966495513916
S021	30	0	When I am elected President, I will make it a top priority to bring cost and increase economic security for all Americans.	0.6774756908416748
S021	30	1	As President, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food.	0.6748723983764648
S021	30	2	We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed, but our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high.	0.6825473308563232

S021	31	0	Look, I know most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy, and playing by the rules, but some are not, and that’s just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case.	0.6686534285545349
S021	31	1	As Attorney General in California, I went after companies that illegally increased prices, including wholesalers that inflated the price of prescription medication and companies that conspired with competitors to keep prices of electronics high.	0.6863559484481812
S021	31	2	I won more than $1 billion for consumers.	0.7030677199363708
S021	31	3	So believe me, as President, I will go after the bad actors, and I will work to pass the first ever federal ban on price gauging on food.	0.6912798881530762
S021	31	4	My plan will include new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules, and we will support smaller food businesses that are trying to play by the rules and get ahead.	0.681817889213562
S021	31	5	We’ll help the food industry become more competitive, because I believe competition is the lifeblood of our economy.	0.6789650917053223
S021	31	6	More competition means lower prices for you and your families.	0.6817337274551392
S021	32	0	Now, compare what Donald Trump plans to do.	0.6608573794364929
S021	32	1	He wants to impose what is in effect a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries.	0.67116779088974
S021	32	2	That will devastate Americans.	0.6930975317955017
S021	32	3	It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs.	0.6845695376396179
S021	32	4	A Trump tax on gas, a Trump tax on food, a Trump tax on clothing, a Trump tax on over-the-counter medication.	0.6772486567497253
S021	32	5	And economists have done the math.	0.66717129945755
S021	32	6	Donald Trump’s plan would cost a typical family $3,900 a year.	0.6690002083778381
S021	32	7	At this moment, when everyday prices are too high, he will make them even higher.	0.6952680349349976
S021	33	0	As President, I’ll attack and take on the issue of the cost of healthcare.	0.6774042248725891
S021	33	1	As Attorney General, I took on insurance companies and Big Pharma and got them to lower their prices.	0.6797063946723938
S021	33	2	And together with President Biden, we’ve gone even further.	0.6771624088287354
S021	33	3	We capped the price of insulin at $35 a month and the total cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year for seniors.	0.6902087926864624
S021	33	4	We let Medicare negotiate lower drug prices for seniors.	0.683941125869751
S021	33	5	And just yesterday, we announced that we are lowering the price by up to 80% for 10 more life-saving drugs.	0.6936280131340027
S021	34	0	And I pledge to continue this progress.	0.6713301539421082
S021	34	1	I’ll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone with your support, not only our seniors, and demand transparency from the middlemen who operate between Big Pharma and the insurance companies who use opaque practices to raise your drug prices and profit off your need for medicine.	0.6752699613571167
S021	34	2	Two months ago, I announced that medical debt will no longer be used against your credit score, and I will work as President with states, like here in North Carolina, Roy Cooper, thank you again, to cancel medical debt for more and more, millions more Americans.	0.6996806263923645
S021	35	0	As for Donald Trump, well, he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which 45 million Americans rely on, 45 million Americans rely on it for healthcare.	0.6542987823486328
S021	35	1	That would take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions.	0.6671225428581238
S021	35	2	We all remember what that was, and we’re not going back.	0.677509069442749
S021	36	0	And let’s talk about the cost of housing.	0.6483814120292664
S021	36	1	So now, the housing market can be complicated, but look, I’m not new to this issue.	0.7003214955329895
S021	36	2	As State Attorney General, I drafted and helped pass a Homeowner Bill of Rights, one of the first in America.	0.6746745705604553
S021	36	3	And during the foreclosure crisis, I took on the big banks for predatory lending with many of my colleagues, including Roy Cooper, and won $20 billion for California families when I was Attorney General.	0.6831105351448059
S021	36	4	So I know how to fight for people who are being exploited in the housing market, and I know what homeownership means.	0.6892917156219482
S021	36	5	It’s more than a financial transaction.	0.6562603116035461
S021	36	6	It’s so much more than that.	0.6711574196815491
S021	36	7	It’s more than a house.	0.6442957520484924
S021	36	8	Homeownership and what that means, it’s a symbol of the pride that comes with hard work.	0.6917068958282471
S021	36	9	It’s financial security.	0.6240456104278564
S021	36	10	It represents what you will be able to do for your children.	0.6800499558448792
S021	37	0	And sadly, right now, it is out of reach for far too many American families.	0.6728587746620178
S021	37	1	There’s a serious housing shortage in many places.	0.669797420501709
S021	37	2	It’s too difficult to build, and it’s driving prices up.	0.6781450510025024
S021	37	3	As President, I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing we need, both to rent and to buy.	0.6755104660987854
S021	37	4	We will take down barriers and cut red tape, including at the state and local levels.	0.6717954277992249
S021	37	5	And by the end of my first term, we will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class.	0.6821421980857849
S021	37	6	And we’ll do that together.	0.6542681455612183
S021	37	7	We’ll do that together.	0.6521011590957642
S021	38	0	And we will make sure those homes actually go to working and middle-class Americans, not just investors.	0.6651719212532043
S021	38	1	Because some corporate landlords, some of them buy dozens if not hundreds of houses and apartments.	0.6933297514915466
S021	38	2	Then, they turn them around and rent them out at extremely high prices, and it can make it impossible then for regular people to be able to buy or even rent a home.	0.7019644975662231
S021	38	3	Some corporate landlords collude with each other to set artificially high rental prices, often using algorithms in price-fixing software to do it.	0.6984682083129883
S021	38	4	It’s anticompetitive, and it drives up costs.	0.6693624258041382
S021	38	5	I will fight for a law that cracks down on these practices.	0.6919363141059875
S021	39	0	We also know that as the price of housing has gone up, the size of down payments have gone up as well.	0.6534076929092407
S021	39	1	Even if aspiring homeowners save for years, it often still is not enough.	0.6879215836524963
S021	39	2	So in addition, while we work on the housing shortage, my administration will provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 to help with the down payment on a new home.	0.6799261569976807
S021	39	3	We can do this, we can do this.	0.6699602007865906
S021	39	4	All to help more Americans experience the pride of homeownership and the financial security that it represents and brings.	0.6792786121368408
S021	40	0	So that’s my plan, but here’s what Donald Trump would do.	0.6650510430335999
S021	40	1	If his Project 2025 agenda is put into effect, it will add around $1,200 a year to the typical American mortgage.	0.6629152894020081
S021	40	2	He’s got it backward.	0.66953045129776
S021	40	3	We should be doing everything we can to make it more affordable to buy a home, not less.	0.6876733303070068
S021	41	0	Finally, there’s one more way I will help families deal with rising cost, and that’s by letting you keep more of your hard-earned money.	0.695838987827301
S021	41	1	Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut, and we will do this by restoring two tax cuts designed to help middle-class and working Americans, the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, through which millions of Americans with children got to keep more of their hard-earned income.	0.6821271777153015
S021	41	2	We know this works and has a direct impact on so many issues, including child poverty.	0.6781042814254761
S021	41	3	We know it works.	0.6500748991966248
S021	41	4	So as President, I’ll not only restore that tax cut but expand it.	0.6879337430000305
S021	41	5	We will provide $6,000 in tax relief to families during the first year of a child’s life.	0.6845919489860535
S021	42	0	Now, think what that means.	0.6718393564224243
S021	42	1	Think what that means.	0.6601616144180298
S021	42	2	That is a vital, vital year of critical development of a child, and the cost can really add up, especially for young parents who need to buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else.	0.6850133538246155
S021	42	3	And we will do this while reducing the deficit.	0.6665237545967102
S021	42	4	Compare my plan with what Donald Trump intends to do.	0.6675131916999817
S021	42	5	He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts, year after year, and he plans to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars even as they pull in record profits.	0.667975127696991
S021	42	6	And that’s on top of the $2 trillion tax cut he already signed into law when he was President, which by the way, overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly, went to the wealthiest Americans and corporations and exploded the national deficit.	0.6713378429412842
S021	42	7	I think that if you want to know who someone cares about, look who they fight for.	0.6717498302459717
S021	42	8	Look who they fight for.	0.6466835141181946
S021	42	9	Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations.	0.6710809469223022
S021	42	10	We, I will fight to give money back to working and middle-class Americans.	0.6700676679611206
S021	43	0	So I’ll end with this.	0.6314476728439331
S021	43	1	Two days ago, Donald Trump was here in North Carolina.	0.667985737323761
S021	43	2	He said he was going to talk about the economy.	0.6560567617416382
S021	43	3	I think you all watched, you know what I’m about to say.	0.6670877933502197
S021	43	4	But he offered no serious plans to reduce cost for middle-class families, no plan to expand access to housing or healthcare.	0.6534017324447632
S021	43	5	And that, actually, I think for most of us was not surprising because we already know his plans.	0.6811231970787048
S021	43	6	We know the Project 2025 agenda.	0.6565422415733337
S021	43	7	So there’s a choice in this election.	0.6528406739234924
S021	43	8	Donald Trump’s plans to devastate the middle class, punish working people, and make the cost of living go up for millions of Americans, and on the other hand, when I’m elected President, what we will do to bring down costs, increase the security and stability financially of your family, and expand opportunity for working and middle-class Americans.	0.6625788807868958
S021	44	0	So now, now, now is the time to chart a new way forward.	0.6570285558700562
S021	44	1	Now is the time to chart a new way forward, to build …	0.6711487174034119
S021	45	0	To build an America where everyone’s work is rewarded and talents are valued, where we work with labor and business to strengthen the American economy, and where everyone has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead.	0.6911661028862
S021	45	1	So I thank you, North Carolina.	0.6958604454994202
S021	45	2	We’re going to get this done, and with your help, God bless you and God bless the United States of America.	0.6870830059051514
S021	45	3	God bless you.	0.6961583495140076
