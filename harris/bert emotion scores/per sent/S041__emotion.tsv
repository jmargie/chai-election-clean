S041	1	1	Thank you, thank you, thank you all.	0.6991643905639648
S041	1	2	Oh, it’s good to be back in North Carolina, I can tell you that.	0.7100129723548889
S041	1	3	It certainly is.	0.6641370058059692
S041	1	4	Well, let me start by thanking Dr.	0.6853182315826416
S041	1	5	Amy Bryant.	0.6415159702301025
S041	1	6	You have heard from her, you know her, she’s extraordinary.	0.6874108910560608
S041	1	7	Like so many of our medical health professionals, these are very trying times.	0.6950044631958008
S041	1	8	And I was talking with some folks backstage about the fact that in times like this, in times of struggle, in times of hardship, these moments also reveal the heroes among us, the people who have the courage to stand strong in service of others, and truly, Dr.	0.6803228259086609
S041	1	9	Bryant is one of those people.	0.6837348937988281
S041	1	10	So thank you for your introduction, and all that you do for your patients here in North Carolina.	0.6769458055496216
S041	1	11	I also want to thank my husband, the first second gentleman of the United States.	0.6921309232711792
S041	1	12	I want to thank my longstanding and dear friend, the governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper.	0.685922384262085
S041	1	13	I think many of you may know, Roy and I actually served together when I was Attorney General of California and he was Attorney General of North Carolina.	0.6805379986763
S041	1	14	I have known him for a long time, he is an extraordinary leader, who always stands up for the rights and the freedoms of the people of North Carolina.	0.6819756031036377
S041	1	15	Roy, thank you.	0.6576661467552185
S041	2	0	We are here today because one year ago today, the United States Supreme Court, the highest court in our land, General Stein, the court of Thurgood, the court of RBG, took a constitutional right that had been recognized From the people of America, from the women of America, a fundamental right, a basic freedom.	0.6747613549232483
S041	2	1	And I know most of us here remember where we were on that day a year ago when the court decided Dobbs, June 24th, 2022.	0.6888902187347412
S041	2	2	I was actually on my way traveling from Washington, DC to a maternal health event in Illinois when I heard the news.	0.6809422373771667
S041	2	3	Outraged, I called my husband, Doug, because there were a collection of words that were coming to mind that would not have been proper for me to speak with some other people.	0.7230733036994934
S041	2	4	And together he and I talked, we talked about our daughter, we talked about my goddaughters, about my niece and her daughters.	0.6808433532714844
S041	2	5	And I couldn’t help but think that their generation would have fewer rights than my generation or my mother’s generation.	0.6809874773025513
S041	2	6	And so the three words that came to me that I publicly spoke were, “How dare they?	0.7165709733963013
S041	2	7	How dare they?	0.7006669044494629
S041	2	8	How dare they?” How dare they attack basic healthcare?	0.6962320804595947
S041	2	9	How dare they attack our fundamental rights?	0.6866257786750793
S041	2	10	How dare they attack our freedom?	0.6871539950370789
S041	2	11	And sadly, one year ago, we accurately predicted what would happen in a world without Roe.	0.6740424633026123
S041	2	12	We knew this decision would create a healthcare crisis in America.	0.6651718616485596
S041	2	13	We knew that old abortion bans would immediately go back into effect, one which was written in 1849.	0.6791056990623474
S041	2	14	Now, check this out, 1849.	0.6662273406982422
S041	2	15	1849, before women had the right to vote, 1849, before the elevator, the telephone, and even the light bulb had been invented.	0.6742385625839233
S041	2	16	And now we know in the midst of this healthcare crisis, extremists, so- called leaders in states across our nation have proposed or passed more than 350 new laws to restrict these freedoms and the right to have access to reproductive healthcare.	0.6697915196418762
S041	2	17	Right now in our country, 23 million women of reproductive age live in a state with an extreme abortion ban in effect.	0.6848263144493103
S041	2	18	23 million women, which means right now in our country, 1 in 3 women of reproductive age live in a state with a ban.	0.6810135841369629
S041	2	19	States like Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Texas, and Wisconsin.	0.6819379329681396
S041	2	20	Some with no exceptions even for survivors of the crimes of rape and incest.	0.7066022753715515
S041	3	0	Now, many of you know, I started my career as a prosecutor intent on protecting, in particular women and children who were the subject and survivors of violence.	0.6915372610092163
S041	3	1	It’s immoral that so-called leaders would not understand and have some compassion for what those exceptions should be.	0.6854945421218872
S041	3	2	Some of the laws are banning at or before six weeks, the right to have an access to have an abortion.	0.6727516651153564
S041	4	0	Now, what most of us here know is that many women don’t even know they are pregnant at six weeks, which by the way, tells us most of these politicians don’t even understand how a woman’s body actually works.	0.6953595876693726
S041	4	1	They don’t get it.	0.6325826048851013
S041	4	2	They don’t get it.	0.6325826048851013
S041	4	3	And next week, overruling the will of the people, North Carolina will be the latest state with an extreme ban in spite of the best efforts of Governor Roy Cooper.	0.6870118379592896
S041	4	4	And so, over the past 365 days, the women	0.6794734597206116
S041	5	0	This is a room full of leaders, a room full of leaders.	0.6698323488235474
S041	5	1	So we gather here with knowledge and a deep and profound belief that America is a promise.	0.6752027273178101
S041	5	2	A promise.	0.6648407578468323
S041	5	3	A promise of freedom and freedom for all.	0.675045371055603
S041	5	4	A promise that each person can determine their own future, dream with ambition, and live with dignity.	0.684485673904419
S041	5	5	A promise that every person truly has the ability to thrive.	0.6857097148895264
S041	5	6	Since the founding of our country, we all know generations of Americans have struggled, sacrificed, and bled to make that promise real.	0.672127366065979
S041	5	7	They spoke out at Seneca Falls.	0.6717316508293152
S041	5	8	They sat in at a lunch counter in Greensboro.	0.6616088151931763
S041	5	9	They organized farm workers in California.	0.6762204766273499
S041	5	10	They fought for equality at the Stonewall Inn.	0.6624772548675537
S041	5	11	And in the relay race of history, the baton they carried is now in our hands.	0.6815195083618164
S041	5	12	We, all of us, are now called upon to advance the promise of freedom, including the freedom of every woman to make decisions about her own body.	0.6729929447174072
S041	5	13	Not the government telling her what to do.	0.6534430980682373
S041	6	0	I know these stories are so hard to hear, so difficult to tell, but we cannot in our nation, allow people to silently suffer without telling their stories in a way that hopefully understands the importance of uplifting their voices in support and in love, and with a sense of empathy and agreement that they shouldn’t have to have those kinds of experiences.	0.6904224753379822
S041	7	0	And Anya’s here today with her husband Derek.	0.6737040281295776
S041	7	1	I want to thank you for telling your story.	0.6869659423828125
S041	7	2	I talked with Anya and Derek.	0.6707478761672974
S041	7	3	My husband and I talked with them before we all came out.	0.6799404621124268
S041	7	4	And I’ll say it to you in front of all the friends, what we talked about backstage if you don’t mind, which is you are a loving couple and you have the great blessing of having that support in your family, and in spite of the pain that you have personally experienced, the kind of courage you have shown to be a voice for so many people who can’t be here or feel alone, is so important.	0.7010613083839417
S041	7	5	And we thank you for your courage and we thank you for your leadership.	0.6780145764350891
S041	8	0	And I guess the point of this is that this should not be the subject of some political discourse.	0.6800857186317444
S041	8	1	These are, we’re talking about real people every day in our country.	0.6759628057479858
S041	8	2	Real people every day who are being subjected to judgment, being made to feel as though they should be silent.	0.6901957392692566
S041	8	3	We can’t stand for that.	0.6539025902748108
S041	8	4	We can’t tolerate that.	0.6495543122291565
S041	8	5	It’s just not right.	0.6769148707389832
S041	9	0	Over these past 365 days, doctors and nurses have also experienced this chaos and confusion and fear.	0.7159509062767029
S041	9	1	They are not only afraid to lose their medical license, which they might.	0.6993679404258728
S041	9	2	These medical professionals, people who have dedicated themselves to the care of perfect strangers, have told me that they fear being prosecuted and going to jail.	0.7011029124259949
S041	9	3	And be clear, in Texas and Alabama, doctors and nurses could go to prison for life.	0.6995877027511597
S041	9	4	Can you imagine someone passing a law saying life imprisonment for a healthcare provider, doing what in their medical judgment is the right thing to do?	0.7030515670776367
S041	9	5	In these past 365 days, extreme laws creating chaos and confusion and fear, laws that have also impaired access to other basic women’s healthcare issues.	0.6986861824989319
S041	9	6	Because you understand, everybody here knows reproductive care clinics have been forced to close.	0.6776864528656006
S041	9	7	Those clinics that offer routine checkups for so many people in the community.	0.6749030947685242
S041	9	8	Trusted by the community.	0.6681717038154602
S041	9	9	They offer referrals from mammograms and other cancer screenings.	0.6939437985420227
S041	9	10	The impact to women’s health issues broadly, is very real.	0.673458993434906
S041	10	0	So one year after the Dobbs decision, we have also seen many women question whether they can even move to any of these states that are passing these extreme laws.	0.6835240721702576
S041	10	1	They’re asking their friends, their families, should I consider going to that state when deciding where to go to school, where to take a job, where to raise a family?	0.6761714220046997
S041	11	0	And North Carolina, please let us do note the hypocrisy at play with these extremists so-called leaders.	0.6813924312591553
S041	11	1	The hypocrisy.	0.6775919795036316
S041	11	2	Because the very people who claim to care about the health of women and babies are the same people who do not treat the maternal mortality crisis as the crisis it is.	0.6631326675415039
S041	11	3	The hypocrisy.	0.6775919795036316
S041	11	4	In the top 10 states in our country with the highest rates of maternal mortality, you see these bans in effect.	0.683794379234314
S041	11	5	The hypocrisy.	0.6775919795036316
S041	11	6	Just consider over half of the counties in Georgia, Oklahoma, and Texas have no OBGYN.	0.7009336352348328
S041	11	7	I did not say a few.	0.6726285815238953
S041	11	8	I said none, not one.	0.6558666825294495
S041	11	9	So as we clearly see the moment we are in and we are united in this movement, we must also understand the larger context.	0.6693720817565918
S041	11	10	This fight is not only about the people of one particular state.	0.6723759770393372
S041	11	11	These extremists plan to take their agenda, national.	0.687960147857666
S041	12	0	Women of our nation have suffered under the consequences of these laws.	0.6639346480369568
S041	12	1	Laws that in design and effect have created chaos, confusion, and fear.	0.7035076022148132
S041	12	2	Laws that have denied the women of our country care, even when their life and health were at risk.	0.6737130284309387
S041	12	3	Women like Kristen from Texas, who during her miscarriage was rushed to the emergency room, who was turned away after the hospital consulted with their lawyers about criminal liability under her state’s extreme ban.	0.6905231475830078
S041	12	4	Kristen, who only received care after she developed sepsis, an infection that could have killed her.	0.70160311460495
S041	12	5	Women like Anya from Florida, who after her water broke prematurely, was also rushed to the emergency room, who was then told sadly for she and her husband, that she would lose her pregnancy and she could die, who was also turned away and refused treatment because of that states extreme law and who hours later nearly bled to death in a public bathroom after a miscarriage.	0.7023576498031616
S041	13	0	So, let’s see the big picture at play here.	0.6230474710464478
S041	13	1	And, of course, a year after Dobbs, it is clear where this is headed.	0.6764051914215088
S041	13	2	Extremist Republicans in Congress have proposed to ban abortion nationwide.	0.6762572526931763
S041	13	3	Nationwide.	0.634286642074585
S041	13	4	But I have news for them: We’re not having that.	0.676105797290802
S041	13	5	We’re not having that.	0.6486138701438904
S041	13	6	We’re not standing for that.	0.6490170955657959
S041	13	7	We won’t let that happen.	0.649380624294281
S041	13	8	And, by the way, the majority of Americans are with us.	0.6714621782302856
S041	13	9	The majority of Americans, I do believe, agree that one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body.	0.671690046787262
S041	13	10	If she chooses, she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi.	0.6735198497772217
S041	13	11	But it should not be the government telling her what to do.	0.6591601967811584
S041	14	0	And I do believe that the majority of Americans agree that an important attribute of a true leader is the ability to have empathy, to truly have some curiosity and concern and care for the struggles of other people.	0.6848741769790649
S041	14	1	This having been the approach, by the way, of people from Kentucky to California, voters of every party, who just last year protected reproductive rights.	0.6677886843681335
S041	15	0	And so, while Americans make their voices heard across our nation, President Biden and I will continue to do our part.	0.6608303189277649
S041	15	1	Our administration has taken action to protect access to emergency medical care, to support women forced to travel out of state for care, and to protect women’s privacy.	0.679743230342865
S041	15	2	But we know this fight will not truly be won until we secure this right for every American, which means, ultimately, the United States Congress must put back in place what the Supreme Court took away.	0.6710656881332397
S041	15	3	And have the courage to stand for freedom in every way.	0.6620419025421143
S041	15	4	The United States Congress must pass legislation to restore the protections of Roe v.	0.6685234308242798
S041	15	5	Wade.	0.630521833896637
S041	15	6	And when they do, President Joe Biden will sign it.	0.667047381401062
S041	16	0	So, North Carolina, all that to say also that elections matter and organizing works.	0.6725464463233948
S041	16	1	So, together, let us continue to build this movement to-	0.6646440625190735
S041	17	0	So, North Carolina, let’s stand because we believe medical decisions should be made by a woman and her doctor, not politicians.	0.6794077754020691
S041	17	1	Stand if you want to end the crisis of maternal mortality, to institute national family and parent paid leave.	0.6610893607139587
S041	17	2	Stand to pass the affordable child care and to uphold the rights of all people to own their future.	0.6476035118103027
S041	17	3	Stand if you love our country.	0.6695399284362793
S041	17	4	Because we are fueled by our love of country, and we stand knowing what we must fight for and what’s at stake.	0.6780419945716858
S041	17	5	And, again, I will say: When we fight, we win.	0.6849821209907532

S041	18	0	A movement … I love you.	0.7083415389060974
S041	18	1	Let’s build our movement, a movement to secure the rights every American.	0.6650241613388062
S041	18	2	Today, 365 days after the Dobbs decision, people in states across our nation are making their voices heard.	0.6739353537559509
S041	18	3	For example, in Florida and Ohio, folks are collecting signatures and registering people to vote to secure reproductive freedom on their ballot.	0.6831260919570923
S041	18	4	Across our nation, people are speaking out.	0.6616477370262146
S041	18	5	They’re raising money to support reproductive freedom.	0.6725851893424988
S041	18	6	And just look around.	0.6596564054489136
S041	18	7	Just look around.	0.6595996022224426
S041	18	8	Together, here, people of every background.	0.6608659029006958
S041	18	9	I wish you could see what I’m looking at.	0.6668407320976257
S041	18	10	People of every background, every age, from everywhere, together, are standing in defense of fundamental, foundational principles for our country; standing in defense for freedom and democracy, for civil rights and human rights and women’s rights.	0.6581318378448486
S041	18	11	And I do believe that when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for.	0.6675416827201843
