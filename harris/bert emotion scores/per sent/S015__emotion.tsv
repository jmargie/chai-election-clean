S015	0	3	Good afternoon.	0.6717380285263062
S015	0	4	Bob and Christina, thank you so very much for that introduction and for your friendship.	0.6902643442153931
S015	0	5	And as I’ve said to all the friends and leaders on the stage with me, we had a chance to speak ahead of time, I thank you all for everything that you are doing and the courage you are showing.	0.6869953870773315
S015	1	0	This is an extraordinary climate right now and I think we all recognize the courage that you are each showing to speak out so publicly and to put as we are saying, because we truly believe at country over parity.	0.6725315451622009
S015	1	1	So thank you all.	0.6929308176040649
S015	1	2	Can we please applaud Bob and Christina and all of the folks on the stage, please?	0.673645555973053
S015	1	3	Thank you.	0.6735612154006958
S015	1	4	Thank you.	0.6735612154006958
S015	1	5	Truly, truly, thank you.	0.6949965357780457
S015	2	0	So if you all have a seat, please do sit.	0.6664251685142517
S015	2	1	Yes.	0.6270259618759155
S015	2	2	So I think everyone here knows we meet in a place that holds a very special meaning for our country.	0.673416793346405
S015	2	3	Here on Christmas Night, 1776, General George Washington and over 2,000 troops crossed the icy Delaware river in darkness, then marched to Trenton where they surprised an outpost of enemy soldiers and achieved a major victory in the American Revolution.	0.6897525787353516
S015	3	0	And after we won the war and achieved our independence, delegates from across the nation gathered not far from here in Philadelphia, to write and to sign the constitution of the United States.	0.6804693341255188
S015	3	1	And we remember and reflect on what that moment was, knowing that leading up to that, that work, to write, to compose the constitution of the United States, that work was not easy.	0.6802135109901428
S015	4	0	The founders often disagreed, often quite passionately.	0.6763547658920288
S015	4	1	But in the end, the constitution of the United States laid out the foundations of our democracy, including the rule of law that there would be checks and balances, that we would have free and fair elections, and a peaceful transfer of power.	0.6635177135467529
S015	4	2	These principles and traditions have sustained our nation for over two centuries sustained because generations of Americans, from all backgrounds, from all beliefs, have cherished them, upheld them, and defended them.	0.6813953518867493
S015	4	3	And now the baton is in our hands.	0.6751148104667664
S015	5	0	So I am joined today by over 100 Republican leaders from across Pennsylvania and across our country who are supporting my candidacy for president of the United States, and I am deeply honored to have their support.	0.708894670009613
S015	5	1	Some served in state houses, some in the United States Congress, some worked for other Republican presidents and presidential nominees including Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W.	0.6644336581230164
S015	5	2	Bush, George H.W.	0.652194082736969
S015	5	3	Bush, and Ronald Reagan.	0.667506754398346
S015	5	4	Some today served in Donald Trump’s own administration.	0.6633557081222534
S015	6	0	We also have with us republican voters from here in Pennsylvania and beyond who have been active in their Republican parties for years, who have supported Republican candidates up and down the ticket.	0.6777881979942322
S015	6	1	Now, I say all that to make an obvious point.	0.70863938331604
S015	6	2	In a typical election year, you all being here with me, might be a bit surprising, dare I say unusual.	0.6822842955589294
S015	6	3	But not in this election.	0.6583684086799622
S015	6	4	Not in this election.	0.6562217473983765
S015	6	5	Because at stake in this race are the democratic ideals that our founders and generations of Americans before us have fought for.	0.6522275805473328
S015	6	6	At stake in this election is the constitution of the United States, it very itself.	0.6514203548431396
S015	6	7	We are here today because we share a core belief that we must put country before party.	0.671099841594696
S015	7	0	And so we know that sacred oath must always be honored and never violated, and that we should expect anyone who seeks the highest office in our land would meet that standard.	0.6570824980735779
S015	7	1	We here know the Constitution is not a relic from our past, but determines whether we are a country where the people can speak freely and even criticize the president without fear of being thrown in jail or targeted by the military, where the people can worship as they choose without the government interfering, where you can vote without fear that your vote will be thrown away.	0.6746993064880371
S015	7	2	All of this and more depends on whether or not our leaders honor their oath to the constitution.	0.6645740866661072
S015	8	0	I have sworn an oath to uphold the constitution six times, including as vice president, as the United States Senator, and as the top law enforcement officer of the largest state in our country.	0.6704672574996948
S015	8	1	I have never wavered from upholding that oath.	0.672374963760376
S015	9	0	And now Donald Trump is telling us how he intends to use power if he is elected again.	0.676408588886261
S015	9	1	He has stated that one of the biggest threats America faces is “the enemy from within.”	0.6775414943695068
S015	10	0	It is clear Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged.	0.7143159508705139
S015	11	0	So as I’ve mentioned, many of you know I spent a career as a prosecutor in law enforcement, and I will tell you, I never asked a victim or a witness, “Are you a Republican or are you a Democrat?” I never asked of anyone who needed help.	0.686105489730835
S015	11	1	If anyone who deserved attention, where were they registered and who did they vote for?	0.658074676990509
S015	11	2	The only question I ever asked was, “Are you okay?” And that is the kind of president I pledge to you that I will be.	0.6860186457633972
S015	11	3	That is my pledge to you, because we have too much to do and too much good work to do, to be relegated, to requiring each of us to be in some silo, disconnected from each other.	0.6841162443161011
S015	11	4	There’s too much good to be done.	0.6845181584358215
S015	11	5	And the challenges that we face as a nation require us if we truly want to create solutions and strengthen our nation, the approach truly requires that we understand we’re all in this together.	0.6841399669647217
S015	12	0	This is so much more than rhetoric or a campaign.	0.6818894147872925
S015	12	1	It really is about tapping into the spirit of who we are as Americans because we are all in this together.	0.6865173578262329
S015	12	2	We are all in this together.	0.6613876819610596
S015	12	3	And so I pledge to be a president who actively works to unite us around our highest aspirations.	0.679767370223999
S015	12	4	I pledge to you to be a president who is realistic and practical and has common sense, and to always fight for the American people, unlike Donald Trump, who frankly as we have seen, cares more about running on problems than fixing problems.	0.6753670573234558
S015	13	0	I want to fix problems, which means working across the aisle.	0.6877212524414062
S015	13	1	It requires working across the aisle.	0.6777611970901489
S015	13	2	It requires embracing good ideas from wherever they come.	0.6891797780990601
S015	13	3	That is why I have pledged to appoint a Republican in my cabinet.	0.6861820220947266
S015	13	4	That is why I have pledged to establish a council on bipartisan solutions to recommend to me common sense solutions to some of the most pressing issues facing our country.	0.6850829124450684
S015	13	5	Because nobody has a corner on the good ideas.	0.676286518573761
S015	13	6	They actually come from many places and one should… Especially if they want to be a leader, one should welcome those ideas, and those ideas which are about, in particular, strengthening the middle class, securing our border, defending our freedoms, and maintaining our leadership in the world.	0.6699013113975525
S015	14	0	And all of this is to also say that I believe for America to be the world’s strongest democracy, we must have a healthy two-party system, because it is when we have a healthy two-party system that leaders are then required to debate the merits of policy and to work, yes, across the aisle regularly and routinely to get things done.	0.6782850623130798
S015	15	0	I have experienced firsthand how important and rewarding that kind of bipartisan cooperation can be.	0.6929651498794556
S015	15	1	So I’ll tell you, when I was the United States senator, I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee.	0.6685152053833008
S015	15	2	It was actually my favorite committee for a number reasons, but specifically this.	0.69225013256073
S015	15	3	There we dealt with some of the most pressing issues affecting national security.	0.6595731973648071
S015	15	4	There we would talk about hotspots around the world and what we needed to do to focus on keeping America safe and secure.	0.647783100605011
S015	15	5	And to do that, we would review classified information which required us to meet in a secure room.	0.6631239652633667
S015	15	6	Adam, you know it’s called a skiff.	0.6459959149360657
S015	15	7	Okay.	0.6071222424507141
S015	16	0	When we would go in that room, with all due respect, no cameras were allowed, no press, and we would roll up our sleeves and get to work.	0.6734970808029175
S015	16	1	I’m telling you, senators of both parties would walk in that room, take off their suit jackets, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table, and we would have real conversations, real conversations as Americans because we understood that what happened in that room, well, the stakes were so high.	0.6857492923736572
S015	16	2	And therefore it could not be, we could not afford to let it be about whether one was a Democrat or a Republican.	0.6745988130569458
S015	16	3	The stakes were too high.	0.6678410172462463
S015	16	4	We were in that room and it was all about us as Americans, about doing what is in the best interest of the safety and security of our nation.	0.6487131118774414
S015	16	5	I love that work.	0.6993885636329651
S015	17	0	And it was what we have as the theme of today, it was country over party in action, in action.	0.6771081686019897
S015	17	1	So I know it can be done, and that is the standard of leadership and the aspiration that I have in terms of how we will work when, with your help, I’m elected president of the United States.	0.6815986633300781
S015	17	2	So-	0.6493671536445618
S015	18	0	So as I have said, our campaign is not a fight against something.	0.6827121376991272
S015	18	1	It is a fight for something.	0.6763344407081604
S015	18	2	It is a fight for the fundamental principles upon which we were founded.	0.6897085905075073
S015	18	3	It is a fight for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can achieve together, Republicans, Democrats, and independents who want to move past the politics of division and blame and get things done on behalf of the American people.	0.6720095872879028
S015	18	4	And when it all comes down to it, I know we are all here together this beautiful afternoon because we love our country.	0.6995561718940735
S015	18	5	We love our country.	0.6913241744041443
S015	18	6	And we are here because we know the deep privilege and pride that comes with being an American and the duty that comes along with it, and the duty that comes along with it.	0.6888419985771179
S015	19	0	Imperfect though we may be, America is still that shining city upon a hill that inspires people around the world.	0.6702763438224792
S015	19	1	And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country.	0.6675369143486023
S015	19	2	So should people from across Pennsylvania and across our nation, let us together stand up for the rule of law, for our democratic ideals, and for the constitution of the United States.	0.6600431203842163
S015	19	3	And in 20 days, we have the power to chart a new way forward, one that is worthy of this magnificent country that we are all blessed to call home.	0.6865440607070923
S015	19	4	Thank you all.	0.676295280456543
S015	19	5	May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.	0.6850233674049377
S015	19	6	Thank you.	0.6735612154006958
S015	20	0	We got to get to work.	0.642782986164093
S015	20	1	We got to get to work.	0.642782986164093
S015	20	2	So let me just say an obvious point.	0.6975716948509216
S015	20	3	There’s a fundamental choice in this election, a very fundamental choice, a choice between the leadership that I pledge to offer to America, leadership that brings folks together that builds consensus and focuses on making life better for you with the knowledge that we have so much more in common than what separates us.	0.6919270753860474
S015	20	4	And on the other hand, the choice of someone who I think we can guarantee will sit in the Oval Office plotting retribution, stew in his own grievances, and think only about himself and not you.	0.6807889938354492
S015	21	0	Good afternoon.	0.6717380285263062
S015	21	1	Good afternoon, Pennsylvania.	0.6870706677436829

S015	34	4	That is why I have pledged to establish a council on bipartisan solutions to recommend to me common sense solutions to some of the most pressing issues facing our country.	0.6850829124450684
S015	34	5	Because nobody has a corner on the good ideas.	0.676286518573761
S015	34	6	They actually come from many places and one should… Especially if they want to be a leader, one should welcome those ideas, and those ideas which are about, in particular, strengthening the middle class, securing our border, defending our freedoms, and maintaining our leadership in the world.	0.6699013113975525
S015	35	0	And all of this is to also say that I believe for America to be the world’s strongest democracy, we must have a healthy two-party system, because it is when we have a healthy two-party system that leaders are then required to debate the merits of policy and to work, yes, across the aisle regularly and routinely to get things done.	0.6782850623130798
S015	36	0	I have experienced firsthand how important and rewarding that kind of bipartisan cooperation can be.	0.6929651498794556
S015	36	1	So I’ll tell you, when I was the United States senator, I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee.	0.6685152053833008
S015	36	2	It was actually my favorite committee for a number reasons, but specifically this.	0.69225013256073
S015	36	3	There we dealt with some of the most pressing issues affecting national security.	0.6595731973648071
S015	36	4	There we would talk about hotspots around the world and what we needed to do to focus on keeping America safe and secure.	0.647783100605011
S015	36	5	And to do that, we would review classified information which required us to meet in a secure room.	0.6631239652633667
S015	36	6	Adam, you know it’s called a skiff.	0.6459959149360657
S015	36	7	Okay.	0.6071222424507141
S015	37	0	When we would go in that room, with all due respect, no cameras were allowed, no press, and we would roll up our sleeves and get to work.	0.6734970808029175
S015	37	1	I’m telling you, senators of both parties would walk in that room, take off their suit jackets, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table, and we would have real conversations, real conversations as Americans because we understood that what happened in that room, well, the stakes were so high.	0.6857492923736572
S015	37	2	And therefore it could not be, we could not afford to let it be about whether one was a Democrat or a Republican.	0.6745988130569458
S015	37	3	The stakes were too high.	0.6678410172462463
S015	37	4	We were in that room and it was all about us as Americans, about doing what is in the best interest of the safety and security of our nation.	0.6487131118774414
S015	37	5	I love that work.	0.6993885636329651
S015	38	0	And it was what we have as the theme of today, it was country over party in action, in action.	0.6771081686019897
S015	38	1	So I know it can be done, and that is the standard of leadership and the aspiration that I have in terms of how we will work when, with your help, I’m elected president of the United States.	0.6815986633300781
S015	38	2	So-	0.6493671536445618
S015	39	0	So as I have said, our campaign is not a fight against something.	0.6827121376991272
S015	39	1	It is a fight for something.	0.6763344407081604
S015	39	2	It is a fight for the fundamental principles upon which we were founded.	0.6897085905075073
S015	39	3	It is a fight for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can achieve together, Republicans, Democrats, and independents who want to move past the politics of division and blame and get things done on behalf of the American people.	0.6720095872879028
S015	39	4	And when it all comes down to it, I know we are all here together this beautiful afternoon because we love our country.	0.6995561718940735
S015	39	5	We love our country.	0.6913241744041443

S015	40	0	Imperfect though we may be, America is still that shining city upon a hill that inspires people around the world.	0.6702763438224792
S015	40	1	And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country.	0.6675369143486023
S015	40	2	So should people from across Pennsylvania and across our nation, let us together stand up for the rule of law, for our democratic ideals, and for the constitution of the United States.	0.6600431203842163
S015	40	3	And in 20 days, we have the power to chart a new way forward, one that is worthy of this magnificent country that we are all blessed to call home.	0.6865440607070923
S015	40	4	Thank you all.	0.676295280456543

S015	41	1	We got to get to work.	0.642782986164093
S015	41	2	So let me just say an obvious point.	0.6975716948509216
S015	41	3	There’s a fundamental choice in this election, a very fundamental choice, a choice between the leadership that I pledge to offer to America, leadership that brings folks together that builds consensus and focuses on making life better for you with the knowledge that we have so much more in common than what separates us.	0.6919270753860474
S015	41	4	And on the other hand, the choice of someone who I think we can guarantee will sit in the Oval Office plotting retribution, stew in his own grievances, and think only about himself and not you.	0.6807889938354492
