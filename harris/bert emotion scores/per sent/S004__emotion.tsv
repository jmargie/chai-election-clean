S004	0	0	I believe that when we think about who we are as the American people, there is more we have in common than what separates us when we think about what is at stake in terms of our democracy, rule of law, the Constitution of the United States, national security, the standing of our country in the context of the world, all of that is at stake.	0.6712663769721985
S004	1	0	And I will share with you, Charlie, when I was in the Senate for those four years that I was there, my favorite committee was the Senate Intelligence Committee.	0.6909195780754089
S004	1	1	And I’m going to tell you why.	0.6556469202041626
S004	1	2	We would walk into that meeting in a SCIF, which is a secure room.	0.6617212295532227
S004	1	3	We’d have to leave our cell phones outside.	0.649915337562561
S004	1	4	The press, with all due respect, were not allowed in, no cameras.	0.6408324837684631
S004	1	5	People would walk in, Democrats and Republicans, take off their suit jacket, roll up their sleeves, and we dispensed with who was a Republican and who was a Democrat.	0.6902409195899963
S004	1	6	We were all Americans.	0.6642389297485352
S004	1	7	We were all in that room with one singular purpose, to concern ourselves as our highest priority with the security and well-being of the United States of America.	0.6525625586509705
S004	1	8	I think those things are at stake in this election.	0.6576464772224426
S004	2	0	Not only has that been said by a former chief of staff of the former president, but we know he has openly talked about his intention to terminate the Constitution of the United States.	0.6696717739105225
S004	2	1	I have taken that oath six times, as district attorney twice, elected and re-elected, as attorney general of the largest state in California, twice, as the United States senator, and actually now as Vice President.	0.6890196204185486
S004	2	2	And the Congresswoman and I have talked about that.	0.6615234017372131
S004	2	3	That is an oath one must take seriously.	0.6654682755470276
S004	2	4	It is a duty to defend and honor and uphold the Constitution of the United States.	0.64825439453125
S004	2	5	He has said he would terminate it.	0.6650159358978271
S004	2	6	Anyone who wants to be president of the United States should never again be able to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States having said they would terminate the Constitution of the United States.	0.6602115035057068
S004	2	7	And again, most recently, the report is that the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a decorated general, said of Donald Trump that he is fascist to the core.	0.6859913468360901
S004	2	8	These are the people who know him best, people who worked with him.	0.6680530309677124
S004	2	9	So yes, we can talk about that moment on stage of the music and all that, but	0.6596745848655701
S004	3	0	What that was.	0.6488702893257141
S004	3	1	I think it does lead us, and it should lead us to observe that he is increasingly unstable.	0.6897464990615845
S004	3	2	But you don’t have to take my word for it.	0.6428757309913635
S004	3	3	Listen to the people who know him best, the people who worked with him in the White House, in the Oval Office, in the situation room.	0.6521490812301636
S004	3	4	His former chief of staff, two former secretaries of defense, his secretaries of defense, his former national security advisor, and, of course, his former vice president.	0.6570098996162415
S004	3	5	And they have each talked about, the chief of staff, that Donald Trump has contempt for the Constitution of the United States.	0.6719235181808472
S004	4	0	And being a role model… This is a room of role models.	0.6722820401191711
S004	4	1	We know as a role model, people watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say.	0.6713825464248657
S004	4	2	One of my very real fears, Charlie, to be candid, is I hope that we as the American people fully understand how important America is to the world.	0.6630416512489319
S004	4	3	I hope we really, really understand that because this is about what will happen to and with us as Americans, but it will impact people around the world.	0.6648437976837158
S004	5	0	If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, rabbi, her imam, but not the government.	0.6715589165687561
S004	5	1	And I also have found though, since the two years that the Dobbs’ decision came down, that this happened, I have had conversations with a number of people who were opposed to abortion and remain opposed to it, but did not intend for the harm that we are seeing to happen.	0.6880118250846863
S004	5	2	And I think as this decision came down and we are seeing the harm, there are more and more people who are agreeing that this should not be the government making this decision for women and their families.	0.6801608800888062
S004	5	3	And the way that we will address this is eventually Congress needs to pass a law restoring those protections.	0.6691856384277344
S004	5	4	And we need to agree that in our society, we should not have laws that are treating people in a way that is causing such harm.	0.6946427822113037
S004	6	0	I’ll give you another example of the harm that is going on.	0.6918770670890808
S004	6	1	I started my career as a prosecutor.	0.6788224577903748
S004	6	2	I have prosecuted everything from low level offenses to homicides, but one of the reasons I became a prosecutor is because when I was in high school, I learned that my best friend was being molested by her stepfather.	0.7223769426345825
S004	6	3	And so I said to her, “You have to come live with us.” I called my mother.	0.6922364234924316
S004	6	4	My mother said, “Of course,” and she did.	0.6789020895957947
S004	6	5	And I made a decision early in my life that I wanted to do the work that was about protecting vulnerable people.	0.6765931844711304
S004	7	0	There are some of these bans that include no exception for rape or incest.	0.6871136426925659
S004	7	1	I have specialized in those kinds of cases.	0.6828129887580872
S004	7	2	And the notion that we would tell a survivor of a crime that is a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next.	0.6904878616333008
S004	7	3	I mean, I think that’s just unconscionable.	0.7088797688484192
S004	7	4	I think it’s immoral.	0.6684219837188721
S004	7	5	And so this is one of the issues that is at play.	0.6745432019233704
S004	7	6	And when this issue has been on the ballot since the Dobbs decision came down in so-called red states and so-called blue states, the American people have voted for freedom.	0.6693614721298218
S004	8	0	And back to the point about just what is in the interest of dignity.	0.6674572229385376
S004	8	1	The President of the United States should have as one of their highest concerns, the dignity of the American people.	0.6405355930328369
S004	8	2	And in particular those who have lived a productive life, who deserve to be able to retire and go into their senior years with the dignity of not worrying about whether they’re going to have a roof over their head or be able to eat.	0.6993260383605957
S004	8	3	So my plan includes what we need to do to strengthen the solvency of Social Security.	0.6748177409172058
S004	8	4	It includes what we’re going to need to do and work with Congress to make sure we’re putting more into it.	0.6430137753486633
S004	8	5	And it cannot be about cutting benefits because right now, those benefits are barely adequate as it is.	0.6772245168685913
S004	9	0	What we must also do is continue to strengthen Medicare around what we’ve been working on, which is to allow Medicare to negotiate prescription medication costs for our seniors.	0.6890314817428589
S004	9	1	So in the last four years, we have now capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors.	0.691821277141571
S004	9	2	This is a huge issue for so many who have otherwise either taken a bus trip to Canada to try and get their prescription medication.	0.6904410123825073
S004	9	3	You’re smiling, you know what I’m talking about.	0.6896818280220032
S004	9	4	Not that you have, I’m not suggesting that.	0.6596686840057373
S004	9	5	And we’ve also capped the cost of prescription medication at $2000 a year for our seniors.	0.6797098517417908
S004	9	6	Understanding again, that this is a related issue, which is what is causing our seniors to be on the verge of bankruptcy and homelessness, by the way.	0.6856880187988281
S004	10	0	The other work that we have to do is to deal with home healthcare and how Medicare is covering that.	0.6661787629127502
S004	10	1	So part of my plan is right now, the only way that there will be coverage for home healthcare is generally speaking Medicaid, which means that the family or the individual would have to spend down all of their savings to be able to be eligible for Medicaid.	0.6824979782104492
S004	10	2	And frankly, I think that’s wrong and it’s just wrong.	0.698296844959259
S004	10	3	I took care of my mother when she was sick.	0.6890836358070374
S004	10	4	And the work that to happen to support our seniors, to be able to stay in their home, to be able to live a life with dignity should include that.	0.6777731776237488
S004	10	5	We will pay attention to the fact that not everybody can afford that help.	0.6609835624694824
S004	11	0	Not everyone has a family member who can do it.	0.6792485117912292
S004	11	1	And so my plan includes having Medicare cover home healthcare work for seniors, so that you can stay in your home, for example, and have someone who can prepare a meal and help you put on a sweater.	0.7053803205490112
S004	11	2	But the core point being dignity and understanding that we should not have a society that allows or requires our seniors to go into poverty in order to qualify for the care that they may need, that I think we most would agree should provide.	0.676007866859436
S004	12	0	I think most of us would agree… And most of us would agree that when we talk about character, it is the sign of strong character to have empathy, to have some of concern and care about the well-being of other people, and then to do something about that.	0.6915464401245117
S004	12	1	And I think there’s so much about this election that calls into question whether we are on a track, with a Donald Trump as president, to actually teach and to show our children our definition of a leader.	0.6890342235565186
S004	12	2	And is that it?	0.6464022994041443
S004	12	3	One of the issues that I think has resulted in the kind of toxicity that you’ve been describing is that he tends to encourage us as Americans to point our fingers at each other.	0.691716730594635
S004	12	4	That’s not in our best interest.	0.6560336947441101
S004	12	5	The vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.	0.6880431771278381
S004	12	6	We are stronger as a nation when we are working toward a common goal, at least on the most basic fundamental priorities.	0.6902217864990234
S004	13	0	And I think in this election, you can look at, for example, how he presents in his events to know that he really does not have a plan for America that is about investing in our future, investing in our children, investing in our economies and new industries, investing in our relationships around the world.	0.6647862792015076
S004	13	1	It’s all about himself and his personal grievances.	0.6728917360305786
S004	13	2	And do we want a president of the United States who spends full time plotting revenge while they sit in the Oval Office or a president who is actually focused on the American people?	0.6578108668327332
S004	13	3	I would also say is a point that I think that congresswoman exemplifies in so many ways, the strength of our democracy requires a strong two-party system.	0.675448477268219
S004	13	4	It really does.	0.663086473941803
S004	13	5	It requires that we have healthy debate, that we have healthy debate based in logic in fact, and that we debate it out, have good various debates, have a good fight over policy.	0.6915896534919739
S004	13	6	That’s good for democracy, but not to point our fingers and call each other names over trivial, petty grievances.	0.6933877468109131
S004	14	0	So I think all of that is at stake in this election, and tapping into the commonalities that we have around some of these fundamental principles, I think is going to be key.	0.6704115867614746
S004	15	0	If Putin were to get away with invading the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine because America, the leader in bringing the allies together in standing for fundamental international rules and norms like sovereignty and territorial integrity, if Vladimir Putin got away with that, you think he wouldn’t march next right into Poland and the rest of Europe, because Donald Trump wants to please somebody that he considers to be a strong man who he admires?	0.6818572878837585
S004	15	1	So on this and so many issues, the stakes are extremely high, but I would say this is a final point for now.	0.6820073127746582
S004	16	0	This is not as much an issue of what we are against is what we are for.	0.6673381924629211
S004	16	1	And I’ll end my point where I started.	0.6509389877319336
S004	16	2	We love our country, and our country is worth fighting for.	0.6881172060966492
S004	16	3	And that’s how I think of this.	0.6663017272949219
S004	16	4	Our democracy will only be as strong as our willingness to fight for it.	0.6696062088012695
S004	16	5	And you all are taking your time out of your lives to be here because we, I think, agree on that among the most fundamental principles at stake.	0.6665812730789185
S004	16	6	And I thank you for the time you’ve taken, and I hope to earn your vote, by the way.	0.6808775663375854
S004	16	7	Thank you.	0.6735612154006958
S004	16	8	Thank you.	0.6735612154006958
S004	16	9	Thank you.	0.6735612154006958
