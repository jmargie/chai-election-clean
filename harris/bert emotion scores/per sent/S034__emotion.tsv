S034	0	0	As we know this, recovery will take time and we will stand with Georgia, and everyone across the southeast who are impacted by these recent storms for as long as it takes to rebuild.	0.655883252620697
S034	0	1	Thank you.	0.6735612154006958
S034	0	2	All right, so Atlanta, we have 17 days left.	0.6719864010810852
S034	0	3	17 days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime.	0.6746346354484558
S034	0	4	And look, let’s have some real talk.	0.6500264406204224
S034	0	5	It’s going to be a tight race until the very end.	0.6172035336494446
S034	0	6	And we are the underdog and we are running as the underdog.	0.6803887486457825
S034	0	7	But make no mistake, we will win.	0.6768637895584106
S034	0	8	We will win.	0.6583869457244873
S034	0	9	Yes, we will.	0.6673502922058105
S034	0	10	We will win.	0.6583869457244873
S034	0	11	Yes, we will,	0.665241003036499
S034	1	0	But none of that is what we hear from Donald Trump.	0.6724655628204346
S034	1	1	Instead, it is just the same old, tired playbook over and over again.	0.7025808691978455
S034	1	2	He has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people.	0.6542917490005493
S034	1	3	He is only focused on himself.	0.6830731630325317
S034	1	4	And now, he’s ducking debates and canceling interviews because of exhaustion.	0.6977565884590149
S034	1	5	And when he does answer a question or speak at a rally, have you noticed he tends to go off script and ramble, and generally for the life of him, cannot finish a thought.	0.7005828619003296
S034	1	6	And he has called it the weave, but I think we here will call it nonsense.	0.6909564733505249
S034	2	0	So folks, for these reasons and more, it is time to turn the page.	0.6824425458908081
S034	2	1	It’s time to turn the page.	0.6638776659965515
S034	2	2	And America is ready to chart a new way forward.	0.6707298755645752
S034	2	3	We are ready.	0.6480286717414856
S034	2	4	We are ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership.	0.6697184443473816
S034	2	5	All of you.	0.6590880155563354
S034	2	6	Which is why Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are supporting our campaign.	0.6676799058914185
S034	2	7	In fact, earlier this week, over 100 Republican leaders from across the country joined me on the campaign trail, including some who worked in Donald Trump’s administration.	0.6841824054718018
S034	2	8	And I believe as I travel our country, Americans really want a President who works for all the American people, all the American people, who understands that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, right?	0.6844643950462341
S034	2	9	Folks are exhausted with someone trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other.	0.7161515951156616
S034	2	10	We’re exhausted with it.	0.6731823682785034
S034	2	11	That’s why I say it’s time to turn the page on that, let’s turn the page, and have a President who cares about all the people.	0.6739216446876526
S034	3	0	And you all know I’ve only ever in my career had one client, the people, the people.	0.6797060966491699
S034	3	1	As a young courtroom prosecutor, I stood up for women and children.	0.6785008311271667
S034	3	2	As Attorney general of California, I fought for students and veterans.	0.6709976196289062
S034	3	3	As Vice President, I have stood up for workers and seniors.	0.6790130138397217
S034	3	4	And as President, I will fight for all the American people.	0.6748594045639038
S034	3	5	And together we will build a brighter future for our nation, together we will build a brighter future that includes what I call an opportunity economy.	0.6844507455825806
S034	3	6	So that every American has the opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business.	0.6852970719337463
S034	3	7	And to build that opportunity economy, we’ve got to bring down the cost of living, because while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still too high.	0.672972559928894
S034	3	8	You know it and I know it.	0.6697150468826294
S034	3	9	And so, I have laid out a comprehensive plan to lower the cost that you pay on everything from prescription medication to groceries.	0.694683313369751
S034	3	10	And this will be my focus every single day as President of the United States.	0.6821829676628113
S034	4	0	I will take on corporate price gouging.	0.6826404333114624
S034	4	1	I’ve done it before and I’ll do it again.	0.6913491487503052
S034	4	2	I will give a middle class tax cut to a hundred million Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child’s life.	0.6968586444854736
S034	4	3	And I’m going to tell you why.	0.6556469202041626
S034	4	4	Because we all know, young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources to do it.	0.6757317185401917
S034	4	5	And we as a community need to understand they are the children of the community.	0.668536365032196
S034	4	6	And it is in our collective best interest to make sure that they have the resources they need during that critical phase of a child’s development, to buy a crib, to buy a car seat, to buy what that child needs during that critical stage of life.	0.6782398819923401
S034	4	7	That’s the kind of leadership that we believe in in America.	0.6608686447143555
S034	5	0	I have a plan to bring down the cost of housing, by building more homes and taking on those corporate landlords who are unfairly buying up properties and increasing rental prices.	0.6768313646316528
S034	5	1	We know what’s happening.	0.6305661201477051
S034	5	2	My plan will lower the cost of starting a small business, including by increasing the tax deduction for entrepreneurs from $5,000 to $50,000, knowing that our small business owners are civic leaders as much as they are business leaders.	0.6949543356895447
S034	5	3	They mentor, they hire locally, they are part of the cultural fabric of our communities and deserve to be lifted up in every way.	0.6827307939529419
S034	5	4	Under my opportunity economy, I have a plan to lower health costs and healthcare costs for people as they age, so they can grow old with dignity, and so their families are not financially crushed by the cost of home care.	0.6885958313941956
S034	5	5	Because look, let me tell you, you all may know this, it’s a personal story.	0.6727380752563477
S034	6	0	I helped take care of my mother when she was sick.	0.693780779838562
S034	6	1	I took care of my mother when she was sick.	0.6890836358070374
S034	6	2	And for any of you who is taking care of an elder relative, you know that’s about love and it’s about care.	0.6860577464103699
S034	6	3	It’s about trying to cook something for them that they feel like eating.	0.6988323330879211
S034	6	4	It’s about trying to help them put on clothes that won’t irritate their skin, help them put on a sweater.	0.6953170299530029
S034	6	5	It’s about from time to time trying to think of something that will put a smile on their face or make them laugh.	0.6954588890075684
S034	6	6	It’s about dignity.	0.6481126546859741
S034	6	7	It’s about dignity.	0.6481126546859741
S034	6	8	But what we know is that right now we have so many people who are doing that and raising small children at the same time.	0.6787694692611694
S034	6	9	We call it the sandwich generation.	0.6907207369804382
S034	6	10	And unless you got a lot of money to be able to hire somebody to help, then folks are looking at the potential of having to leave their job, which is losing a source of income or worse, even having to spend down whatever might be their savings to be able to qualify for Medicaid.	0.6875448226928711
S034	7	0	That’s not right.	0.6690905094146729
S034	7	1	That’s not right.	0.6690905094146729
S034	7	2	So my plan includes allowing Medicare to cover the cost of home healthcare for our seniors.	0.6809385418891907
S034	7	3	It’s a matter of dignity.	0.6409952044487
S034	7	4	Dignity.	0.6685047745704651
S034	7	5	And so, I share some of these details with you to just let you know what you are already know.	0.672727644443512
S034	7	6	I will always put the middle class and working families first.	0.6611260771751404
S034	7	7	I always will.	0.6658380031585693
S034	7	8	I come from the middle class and I will never forget where I come from.	0.7077239155769348
S034	7	9	I will never forget where I come from.	0.6967250108718872
S034	7	10	Now, Donald Trump, you know here I go.	0.6898943781852722
S034	7	11	Now, Donald Trump, well, he has a different plan.	0.6605654358863831
S034	7	12	Just Google Project 2025.	0.6764574646949768
S034	7	13	Now, I say it every time, but I just have to say again, can you believe they put that thing in writing?	0.7183628082275391
S034	7	14	They put it in writing, they published it, they bound it and handed it out.	0.6780096888542175
S034	7	15	And when you read it, you know it is a detailed	0.6780170798301697
S034	8	0	We got the old school.	0.6299169659614563
S034	8	1	And we will win.	0.6673079133033752
S034	8	2	And we will win because we understand what is at stake.	0.6785147190093994
S034	8	3	This election is about two very different visions for our nation.	0.666837215423584
S034	8	4	One, Donald Trump’s, who is focused on the past, and ours that is focused on the future.	0.6545913815498352
S034	8	5	Ours that is focused on bringing down the cost of living, investing in small businesses and entrepreneurs.	0.6553952097892761
S034	8	6	By the way, I love our small businesses.	0.7017087936401367
S034	8	7	Can I see the small business leaders and entrepreneurs?	0.6691914796829224
S034	8	8	I’m telling you, our small businesses are the backbone of America’s economy, I thank you all.	0.6897907257080078
S034	8	9	And we are here because we are committed to protecting reproductive freedom.	0.6711319088935852
S034	9	0	Oh, y’all watched the debate?	0.6610264182090759
S034	9	1	I see you.	0.6543223857879639
S034	9	2	He has, quote, “Concepts of a plan.” So you all know, and you’ve heard me say, look, I think, and I do believe Donald Trump is an unserious man and the consequences of him ever being again in the White House are brutally serious.	0.6999861598014832
S034	9	3	Brutally serious.	0.6738771796226501
S034	9	4	Because think about it, the man’s going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million Americans based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions.	0.6851488947868347
S034	9	5	You remember what that was?	0.6802177429199219
S034	9	6	Well, we are not going back.	0.6773039698600769
S034	9	7	We are not going back.	0.664142370223999
S034	9	8	We are not going back.	0.664142370223999
S034	9	9	We’re not going back.	0.6375125646591187
S034	9	10	We’re not going back.	0.6375125646591187
S034	9	11	We’re not going back.	0.6375125646591187
S034	10	0	And we know how we got here.	0.6745344996452332
S034	10	1	Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe V.	0.6707384586334229
S034	10	2	Wade.	0.630521833896637
S034	10	3	And they did as he intended.	0.6662576198577881
S034	10	4	And now in America, more than one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban.	0.6797386407852173
S034	10	5	Today, except for Virginia, every state in the south, including Georgia, has a Trump ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape or incest, which is telling a survivor of a violation to their body they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next.	0.6930062770843506
S034	10	6	That’s immoral.	0.630652904510498
S034	10	7	That’s immoral.	0.630652904510498
S034	11	0	And let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do.	0.6709341406822205
S034	11	1	Not the government.	0.6334003806114197
S034	11	2	If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her Rabbi, Imam, but not the government telling her what to do.	0.673383355140686
S034	12	0	So look, we all know this is a healthcare crisis.	0.6782459020614624
S034	12	1	This is not something theoretical.	0.6957788467407227
S034	12	2	This is not just about a political conversation.	0.6768221855163574
S034	12	3	It’s very real.	0.6513558030128479
S034	12	4	And Donald Trump is the architect.	0.6792832016944885
S034	12	5	Women are being denied care during miscarriages.	0.6836944222450256
S034	12	6	Some only being treated once they develop sepsis.	0.7057294845581055
S034	12	7	And tragically, because of these bans, some women have even died.	0.6890068054199219
S034	12	8	Let me show you what I’m talking about.	0.6557009816169739
S034	12	9	Roll the clip.	0.6088642477989197
S034	13	0	So here’s the thing that you got to understand, and I think everyone’s following this.	0.6748999357223511
S034	13	1	Donald Trump still refuses to take accountability, to take any accountability for the pain and the suffering he has caused or even to just acknowledge the pain and suffering that has actually happened.	0.6845948696136475
S034	13	2	In a Fox town hall earlier this week, he even mocked Amber’s family for sharing their story.	0.6942402720451355
S034	14	0	Play the clip.	0.6147814989089966
S034	15	0	But here’s the thing.	0.6194450259208679
S034	15	1	Here’s the thing.	0.5903981328010559
S034	15	2	Here’s the thing.	0.5903981328010559
S034	15	3	A grieving family, a grieving family sharing the memory of their daughter with our nation.	0.6695200800895691
S034	15	4	Where is the compassion?	0.6804149746894836
S034	15	5	Part of what’s wrong with what’s been happening in this so-called Trump era, is that there’s this backward notion that somehow the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we know, which is that the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.	0.6758776307106018
S034	15	6	It’s based on who you lift up.	0.6381292343139648
S034	15	7	And what we see continually from Donald Trump is exactly what that clip shows.	0.6897741556167603
S034	15	8	He belittles their sorrow, making it about himself and his television ratings.	0.7026865482330322
S034	15	9	It is cruel.	0.6757196187973022
S034	16	0	And listen, I promised Amber’s mother that we will always remember her story and speak her name, Amber Nicole Thurman, Amber Nicole Thurman.	0.6812316179275513
S034	16	1	And Amber’s family, including her parents, Shanette and Andre are here with us tonight.	0.6688932776451111
S034	16	2	And in front of all the friends here, I thank them both for their courage and their strength.	0.6814725995063782
S034	16	3	And it is my pledge to the family… And I have pledged to the family, it is my pledge to everybody here, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law.	0.6829197406768799
S034	16	4	I will proudly sign it into law.	0.6895813345909119
S034	16	5	So there’s so much at stake.	0.6731277108192444
S034	16	6	And I’m traveling the country and everybody here knows across our nation we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won fundamental freedoms and rights.	0.6862192749977112
S034	16	7	Like right here in Georgia, the freedom to vote.	0.6718554496765137
S034	16	8	The freedom we are seeing in so many places in our country, an attack on the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride.	0.6733366847038269
S034	16	9	So, so much is on the line in this election.	0.6697223782539368
S034	16	10	And this election is not 2016 or 2020.	0.6645230054855347
S034	17	0	The stakes are even higher for obvious reasons, including because just a few months ago, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president, he is effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House.	0.687922477722168
S034	17	1	And just think about this.	0.6748184561729431
S034	17	2	So before that ruling just a few months ago at least there was some possibility of threat of consequence for misbehavior, for breaking the law.	0.6849683523178101
S034	17	3	But just imagine now Donald Trump with no guardrails.	0.679366946220398
S034	17	4	He who has vowed that he will be a dictator on day one; he who calls Americans who disagree with him the enemy from within, understand where that comes from in history and says he would use the American military to go after American citizens; he who has called for the termination, I quote, “Of the Constitution of the United States of America.” And let us be very clear: Someone who suggests that we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States of America.	0.6719421744346619
S034	17	5	Never again.	0.6533336639404297
S034	17	6	Never again.	0.6533336639404297
S034	17	7	Never again.	0.6533336639404297
S034	17	8	So Georgia, it comes down to this.	0.6463929414749146
S034	17	9	We are all here together because we know what is at stake.	0.6689412593841553
S034	17	10	We are all here together because we love our country.	0.6859630346298218
S034	17	11	We love our country.	0.6913241744041443
S034	17	12	And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country.	0.6665093302726746
S034	17	13	That’s what this is about.	0.6313774585723877
S034	17	14	This is about a fight for the promise of America.	0.6631079912185669
S034	18	0	And the extraordinary great Congressman John Lewis reminded us that “Democracy is not a state.	0.6780492663383484
S034	18	1	It is an act.” It is an act.	0.6800525188446045
S034	18	2	So Georgia, now is our time to act.	0.6641718149185181
S034	18	3	The baton is in our hands.	0.6615556478500366
S034	18	4	Election day is in 17 days and early voting has already started.	0.6886725425720215
