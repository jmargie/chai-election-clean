S033	0	4	And again, I’m speaking to the Black journalists who care about all people, but in particular, I’ll talk about the impact on Black people where we know Black folks are 60 times more likely, 60%, excuse me, more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes.	0.6833460927009583
S033	0	5	And we have now finally capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month, capped the cost of prescription medication for our seniors at $2,000 a year because we, unlike the former president who promised to do it, we finally have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices against the big pharmaceutical companies.	0.6921170353889465

S033	1	4	Yes.	0.6270259618759155
S033	1	5	And I will tell you, I do believe that I offer a new generation of leadership for our country that is about, in particular turning the page on an era that sadly has shown us attempts by some to incite fear to create division in our country.	0.6791012287139893
S033	1	6	And to do the work that is about bringing some level of optimism and dare I say, ambition about what I know is possible in our country.	0.6790313124656677
S033	1	7	And so my plan for the economy includes what I imagine and believe and call an opportunity economy, what we can do to grow an opportunity economy where all people have access to the resources to compete, to apply their incredible work ethic, their ambition, their aspirations, and their dreams.	0.6872224807739258
S033	1	8	And actually not just get by, but get ahead.	0.6997105479240417
S033	1	9	And I can talk in more detail about it, but specifically I’ll mention a few things.	0.6729942560195923
S033	2	0	One of the big issues that affects people right now in terms of the economy and their economic well-being is we have a shortage of housing supply.	0.6674026846885681
S033	2	1	It’s too expensive.	0.6616124510765076
S033	2	2	People can’t afford to buy a home.	0.6636151671409607
S033	2	3	We grew up our parents where they had the ability to somehow believe the American dream was attainable, not so much for younger working people.	0.6865901350975037
S033	2	4	And I recognize that, so my approach is a new approach, which is to say, let’s just take this and deal with it head on.	0.698034942150116
S033	2	5	And part of my approach is to say, I’m going to employ and engage the private sector, in particular home builders with tax credits to give them the incentive to create new housing, three million by the end of my first term.	0.6867555379867554
S033	2	6	And understanding that not everybody is handed a silver spoon, but works hard and is trying to save up for a down payment.	0.6820652484893799
S033	3	0	Part of my plan, under my opportunity economy is to give first time home buyers a $25,000 down payment assistance so they can just get their foot in the door to be able to then engage in what will prove to be their opportunity to build intergenerational wealth.	0.6826561093330383
S033	3	1	And here’s my personal experience coming at that.	0.6728063821792603
S033	3	2	I grew up a middle class kid.	0.6843817830085754
S033	3	3	My mother was hardworking.	0.6631312966346741
S033	3	4	She raised me and my sister, Maya.	0.6664310693740845
S033	3	5	She saved up.	0.6532807350158691
S033	3	6	And it was only by the time I was a teenager that she could afford to actually buy her first home.	0.6911028623580933
S033	3	7	And I know and I identify with it, I know where I come from.	0.708138644695282
S033	4	0	But I want to also get back to the earlier point that you made about extending the child tax credit, so part of my new approach is we need to expand the child tax credit.	0.6836772561073303
S033	4	1	And so part of my plan that is under an opportunity economy is to extend and expand the child tax credit to $6,000 so that young families in particular for the first year of their child’s life, which is an extraordinarily important time in their development, have the resources to be able to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy children’s clothing, and not have to worry about whether they’re going to be able to meet their other needs.	0.6938664317131042
S033	4	2	And I don’t need to remind anybody here, especially these esteemed journalists, but when we expanded the child tax credit a couple of years ago, we reduced Black child poverty by half.	0.6829696893692017
S033	4	3	And so again, if you talk about the benefit and if you think about the benefit to the economy overall, it strengthens our economy to do things like pay attention to affordable child care, affordable home healthcare, and extending the child tax credit.	0.6752930879592896
S033	5	0	I appreciate the spirit of the question, but I’ll tell you, I’ve often been asked this question in a way that I’ve had to respond by first saying that	0.6941857933998108
S033	6	0	So my work has included as Vice President getting billions more dollars into community banks, including working with the big banks to do that, so that we can increase access to capital for our small businesses, for our startups.	0.680898904800415
S033	6	1	Part of my plan under my economic opportunity plan going forward is that right now start up entrepreneurs, small businesses only get a tax deduction of $5,000.	0.6775546669960022
S033	6	2	Nobody can start a small business with $5,000.	0.6889356970787048
S033	6	3	So I’m expanding that to $50,000.	0.6618437170982361
S033	6	4	Understanding again, that when people have the opportunity to have the resources to get started, they’re going to put the good ideas, they’re going to put the hard work into it.	0.678391695022583
S033	6	5	And part of what I also know is that our young black men, our black men, just like any group of people, anybody, our small businesses are really the backbone of our economy overall.	0.6783676147460938
S033	6	6	And when they do better economically, we all do better.	0.7015694975852966
S033	7	0	Part of my work is about understanding what we need to do in dealing with, for example, the historic inequities that have faced the black community around home-ownership.	0.6726691722869873
S033	7	1	I don’t have to go through the history with anybody here about what that has meant in terms of redlining, what that has meant in terms of biases and home appraisals, and the impact it has had on stemming the opportunity to build intergenerational wealth because of those obstacles.	0.6820946931838989
S033	7	2	So part of the work that I have done and will continue to do is identify, speak truth about those obstacles and address them.	0.676906168460846
S033	7	3	Another example is medical debt.	0.7046126127243042
S033	7	4	One in four black families or individuals is more likely to carry medical debt than others.	0.6877627372741699
S033	7	5	So part of my perspective, and as Vice President, part of the work that we have done is to say that we’re going to eliminate medical debt from being on your credit score.	0.690787136554718
S033	8	0	Because until now, medical debt worked against your credit score, and people know their credit score like you know your weight.	0.7047252655029297
S033	8	1	You know that number.	0.6271820068359375
S033	8	2	And the difference between what that number is and what it needs to be is the difference between you being able to get a car loan, a small business loan, or even a lease on an apartment.	0.6898800730705261
S033	8	3	And so part of my approach is understanding the obstacles that traditionally and currently exist to allow anyone, including black men, be able to achieve economic wealth.	0.6715517044067383
S033	8	4	And I’m going to tell you, I don’t think it is sufficient to just only talk about economic policy around reducing unemployment.	0.683000385761261
S033	8	5	It is an important marker.	0.649717390537262
S033	8	6	And I’m proud of the work that we’ve done thus far.	0.6948438286781311
S033	8	7	But it should be a baseline there, everybody’s working.	0.6569815874099731
S033	8	8	The point is, do people have an opportunity to build wealth if that’s what they choose to do, if that’s what they want to do.	0.6857884526252747
S033	9	0	And a lot of my perspective as we go forward is just that.	0.6770126819610596
S033	9	1	I believe that there are a lot of opportunities that are available to the American people if we just see people, and understand what they want for themselves and their families, and then meet them where they are.	0.6770504713058472
S033	10	0	Well, first of all, as you mentioned, Sheila Jackson Lee, she	0.6636854410171509
S033	11	0	But part of what we can do right now is, for example, what I’m talking about in terms of building an opportunity economy.	0.6687748432159424
S033	11	1	Which is addressing explicitly the obstacles that historically and currently exist and dealing with them.	0.6699102520942688
S033	11	2	Student loan debt, medical debt, bias in home appraisals.	0.6919219493865967
S033	11	3	What we need to do in terms of dealing with an issue that I have championed for years, black maternal mortality, which is the fact that black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women.	0.6822003126144409
S033	11	4	And we know that the reasons for that include disparities that pre-exist her pregnancy, including disparities that exist in the system during her pregnancy.	0.6794249415397644
S033	11	5	So all of those things must be addressed.	0.6683701276779175
S033	12	0	As Attorney general of California, fifth-largest economy in the world, I was acutely aware that my words could move markets.	0.681029200553894
S033	12	1	When you are bestowed with a microphone that is that big, there is a profound responsibility that comes with that.	0.6827800273895264
S033	12	2	That is an extension of what should not be lost in this moment.	0.6647357940673828
S033	12	3	This concept of the public trust to then understand what the public trust means, it means that you have been invested with trust to be responsible in the way you use your words, much less how you conduct yourself.	0.6782740354537964
S033	12	4	And especially when you have been and then seek to be again, President of the United States of America.	0.6732122898101807
S033	13	0	And so I go back to it’s a crying shame, literally.	0.7119726538658142
S033	13	1	What’s happening to those families, those children in that community, not to mention what is happening in terms of… Look, you say you care about law enforcement, law enforcement resources, being put into this because of these serious threats that are being issued against a community that is living a productive good life before this happened.	0.6839773654937744
S033	13	2	And spewing lies that are grounded in tropes that are age-old.	0.7097344398498535
S033	13	3	And look, I said it not very far from here the other day at the debate.	0.6836621761322021
S033	13	4	This is not new.	0.6733863353729248
S033	13	5	This is not new in terms of these tropes.	0.6789460182189941
S033	13	6	This is not new in terms of where it’s coming from and whether it is refusing to rent to people, rent to black families, whether it is taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times against five innocent Black and Latino teenagers, The Central Park Five calling for their execution, whether it is referring to the first black President of the United States with a lie, [inaudible 00:31:39] their lies.	0.6837378740310669
S033	14	0	And look, the American people deserve, and I do believe want better than this.	0.6718935966491699
S033	14	1	I do believe that.	0.6731005311012268
S033	14	2	I know, I know the vast majority of us as Americans know, we have so much more in common than what separates us.	0.6913278698921204
S033	14	3	I know that.	0.660313069820404
S033	14	4	I know that regardless of someone’s background, their race, their gender, their geographic location, I know that people are deeply troubled by what is happening to that community in Springfield, Ohio.	0.6858808994293213
S033	14	5	And it’s got to stop.	0.6465653777122498
S033	14	6	And we’ve got to say that you cannot be entrusted with standing behind the seal of the President of the United States of America engaging in that hateful rhetoric that as usual is designed to divide us as a country, is designed to have people pointing fingers at each other.	0.6919611692428589
S033	15	0	It’s designed to do that.	0.6066767573356628
S033	15	1	And I think most people in our country, regardless of their race, are starting to see through this nonsense and to say, you know what?	0.6847931146621704
S033	15	2	Let’s turn the page on this.	0.6628383994102478
S033	15	3	This is exhausting and it’s harmful and it’s hateful and grounded in some age-old stuff that we should not have the tolerance for.	0.7060461044311523
S033	15	4	So let’s turn the page and chart a new way forward and say you can’t have that microphone again.	0.6885309815406799
S033	16	0	Which is why I also have been very adamant for years.	0.6884223818778992
S033	16	1	In fact, I myself protested at a gun show probably 10, 15 years ago about the gun show loophole and why we need to close that.	0.695220947265625
S033	16	2	Because what ends up happening is that gun shows at flea markets, gun dealers are not under existing law in the past required to register their sales.	0.6765932440757751
S033	16	3	And so you are exactly right that a lot of homicides, for example, a good number of them, I don’t have the statistic in front of my mind, are committed with illegally purchased guns.	0.6932922601699829
S033	16	4	And that’s why we need to address each entry point in the issue, including universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole,	0.665283203125
S033	17	0	And we must take it seriously, in every way, understanding it’s not just about a soundbite.	0.6802799701690674
S033	17	1	It’s about a comprehensive approach that deals with the tragedy of, to your point, everyday gun violence in America.	0.6804457902908325
S033	17	2	It’s real.	0.6185993552207947
S033	17	3	It has had a profound impact in terms of trauma that for the most part has gone undiagnosed and untreated.	0.6936457753181458
S033	17	4	The trauma that exists in communities around the violence of losing their children, losing a brother, losing a father, an uncle.	0.6945059299468994
S033	17	5	All of that must be addressed and we have to have a holistic response to it.	0.6711394190788269
S033	18	0	It’s about understanding what we need to do to, again, understand that, to your point, we have to have a holistic response to this issue and prioritize it instead of reacting to the tragedy that, sadly, they are too predictable.	0.6950122714042664
S033	18	1	Let’s all agree, enough of that.	0.6661922335624695
S033	18	2	There are very few solutions that we haven’t thought of.	0.6880626082420349
S033	18	3	We need to put the resources into them.	0.6431373953819275
S033	19	0	Laws that make no exception, even for rape or incest, which means that you’re telling a survivor of a crime of a violation to their body, that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, which is immoral.	0.688330888748169
S033	19	1	An approach that doesn’t take into account that most people, I think agree, you don’t have to abandon your faith or deeply held beliefs to agree, the government should not be telling her what to do with her body.	0.6705496311187744
S033	19	2	If she chooses, she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her imam, but it should not be the government or Donald Trump telling her what to do about her own body and her life.	0.6728690266609192
S033	19	3	So, that’s where I stand.	0.6222660541534424
S033	19	4	We need to put back in place the protection of Roe v.	0.6642695069313049

S033	20	3	We have done the work of capping the cost of prescription medication for our seniors for issues like insulin.	0.6816251277923584
S033	20	4	And again, I’m speaking to the Black journalists who care about all people, but in particular, I’ll talk about the impact on Black people where we know Black folks are 60 times more likely, 60%, excuse me, more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes.	0.6833460927009583
S033	20	5	And we have now finally capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month, capped the cost of prescription medication for our seniors at $2,000 a year because we, unlike the former president who promised to do it, we finally have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices against the big pharmaceutical companies.	0.6921170353889465

S033	24	2	And I don’t need to remind anybody here, especially these esteemed journalists, but when we expanded the child tax credit a couple of years ago, we reduced Black child poverty by half.	0.6829696893692017
S033	24	3	And so again, if you talk about the benefit and if you think about the benefit to the economy overall, it strengthens our economy to do things like pay attention to affordable child care, affordable home healthcare, and extending the child tax credit.	0.6752930879592896
S033	25	0	I appreciate the spirit of the question, but I’ll tell you, I’ve often been asked this question in a way that I’ve had to respond by first saying that	0.6941857933998108
S033	26	0	So my work has included as Vice President getting billions more dollars into community banks, including working with the big banks to do that, so that we can increase access to capital for our small businesses, for our startups.	0.680898904800415
S033	26	1	Part of my plan under my economic opportunity plan going forward is that right now start up entrepreneurs, small businesses only get a tax deduction of $5,000.	0.6775546669960022
S033	26	2	Nobody can start a small business with $5,000.	0.6889356970787048
S033	26	3	So I’m expanding that to $50,000.	0.6618437170982361
S033	26	4	Understanding again, that when people have the opportunity to have the resources to get started, they’re going to put the good ideas, they’re going to put the hard work into it.	0.678391695022583
S033	26	5	And part of what I also know is that our young black men, our black men, just like any group of people, anybody, our small businesses are really the backbone of our economy overall.	0.6783676147460938
S033	26	6	And when they do better economically, we all do better.	0.7015694975852966
S033	27	0	Part of my work is about understanding what we need to do in dealing with, for example, the historic inequities that have faced the black community around home-ownership.	0.6726691722869873
S033	27	1	I don’t have to go through the history with anybody here about what that has meant in terms of redlining, what that has meant in terms of biases and home appraisals, and the impact it has had on stemming the opportunity to build intergenerational wealth because of those obstacles.	0.6820946931838989
S033	27	2	So part of the work that I have done and will continue to do is identify, speak truth about those obstacles and address them.	0.676906168460846
S033	27	3	Another example is medical debt.	0.7046126127243042
S033	27	4	One in four black families or individuals is more likely to carry medical debt than others.	0.6877627372741699
S033	27	5	So part of my perspective, and as Vice President, part of the work that we have done is to say that we’re going to eliminate medical debt from being on your credit score.	0.690787136554718
S033	28	0	Because until now, medical debt worked against your credit score, and people know their credit score like you know your weight.	0.7047252655029297
S033	28	1	You know that number.	0.6271820068359375
S033	28	2	And the difference between what that number is and what it needs to be is the difference between you being able to get a car loan, a small business loan, or even a lease on an apartment.	0.6898800730705261
S033	28	3	And so part of my approach is understanding the obstacles that traditionally and currently exist to allow anyone, including black men, be able to achieve economic wealth.	0.6715517044067383
S033	28	4	And I’m going to tell you, I don’t think it is sufficient to just only talk about economic policy around reducing unemployment.	0.683000385761261
S033	28	5	It is an important marker.	0.649717390537262
S033	28	6	And I’m proud of the work that we’ve done thus far.	0.6948438286781311
S033	28	7	But it should be a baseline there, everybody’s working.	0.6569815874099731
S033	28	8	The point is, do people have an opportunity to build wealth if that’s what they choose to do, if that’s what they want to do.	0.6857884526252747
S033	29	0	And a lot of my perspective as we go forward is just that.	0.6770126819610596
S033	29	1	I believe that there are a lot of opportunities that are available to the American people if we just see people, and understand what they want for themselves and their families, and then meet them where they are.	0.6770504713058472
S033	30	0	Well, first of all, as you mentioned, Sheila Jackson Lee, she	0.6636854410171509
S033	31	0	But part of what we can do right now is, for example, what I’m talking about in terms of building an opportunity economy.	0.6687748432159424
S033	31	1	Which is addressing explicitly the obstacles that historically and currently exist and dealing with them.	0.6699102520942688
S033	31	2	Student loan debt, medical debt, bias in home appraisals.	0.6919219493865967
S033	31	3	What we need to do in terms of dealing with an issue that I have championed for years, black maternal mortality, which is the fact that black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women.	0.6822003126144409
S033	31	4	And we know that the reasons for that include disparities that pre-exist her pregnancy, including disparities that exist in the system during her pregnancy.	0.6794249415397644
S033	31	5	So all of those things must be addressed.	0.6683701276779175
S033	32	0	As Attorney general of California, fifth-largest economy in the world, I was acutely aware that my words could move markets.	0.681029200553894
S033	32	1	When you are bestowed with a microphone that is that big, there is a profound responsibility that comes with that.	0.6827800273895264
S033	32	2	That is an extension of what should not be lost in this moment.	0.6647357940673828
S033	32	3	This concept of the public trust to then understand what the public trust means, it means that you have been invested with trust to be responsible in the way you use your words, much less how you conduct yourself.	0.6782740354537964
S033	32	4	And especially when you have been and then seek to be again, President of the United States of America.	0.6732122898101807
S033	33	0	And so I go back to it’s a crying shame, literally.	0.7119726538658142
S033	33	1	What’s happening to those families, those children in that community, not to mention what is happening in terms of… Look, you say you care about law enforcement, law enforcement resources, being put into this because of these serious threats that are being issued against a community that is living a productive good life before this happened.	0.6839773654937744
S033	33	2	And spewing lies that are grounded in tropes that are age-old.	0.7097344398498535
S033	33	3	And look, I said it not very far from here the other day at the debate.	0.6836621761322021
S033	33	4	This is not new.	0.6733863353729248
S033	33	5	This is not new in terms of these tropes.	0.6789460182189941
S033	33	6	This is not new in terms of where it’s coming from and whether it is refusing to rent to people, rent to black families, whether it is taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times against five innocent Black and Latino teenagers, The Central Park Five calling for their execution, whether it is referring to the first black President of the United States with a lie, [inaudible 00:31:39] their lies.	0.6837378740310669
S033	34	0	And look, the American people deserve, and I do believe want better than this.	0.6718935966491699
S033	34	1	I do believe that.	0.6731005311012268
S033	34	2	I know, I know the vast majority of us as Americans know, we have so much more in common than what separates us.	0.6913278698921204
S033	34	3	I know that.	0.660313069820404
S033	34	4	I know that regardless of someone’s background, their race, their gender, their geographic location, I know that people are deeply troubled by what is happening to that community in Springfield, Ohio.	0.6858808994293213
S033	34	5	And it’s got to stop.	0.6465653777122498
S033	34	6	And we’ve got to say that you cannot be entrusted with standing behind the seal of the President of the United States of America engaging in that hateful rhetoric that as usual is designed to divide us as a country, is designed to have people pointing fingers at each other.	0.6919611692428589
S033	35	0	It’s designed to do that.	0.6066767573356628
S033	35	1	And I think most people in our country, regardless of their race, are starting to see through this nonsense and to say, you know what?	0.6847931146621704
S033	35	2	Let’s turn the page on this.	0.6628383994102478
S033	35	3	This is exhausting and it’s harmful and it’s hateful and grounded in some age-old stuff that we should not have the tolerance for.	0.7060461044311523
S033	35	4	So let’s turn the page and chart a new way forward and say you can’t have that microphone again.	0.6885309815406799
S033	36	0	Which is why I also have been very adamant for years.	0.6884223818778992
S033	36	1	In fact, I myself protested at a gun show probably 10, 15 years ago about the gun show loophole and why we need to close that.	0.695220947265625
S033	36	2	Because what ends up happening is that gun shows at flea markets, gun dealers are not under existing law in the past required to register their sales.	0.6765932440757751
S033	36	3	And so you are exactly right that a lot of homicides, for example, a good number of them, I don’t have the statistic in front of my mind, are committed with illegally purchased guns.	0.6932922601699829
S033	36	4	And that’s why we need to address each entry point in the issue, including universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole,	0.665283203125

S033	37	1	It’s about a comprehensive approach that deals with the tragedy of, to your point, everyday gun violence in America.	0.6804457902908325
S033	37	2	It’s real.	0.6185993552207947

S033	38	0	It’s about understanding what we need to do to, again, understand that, to your point, we have to have a holistic response to this issue and prioritize it instead of reacting to the tragedy that, sadly, they are too predictable.	0.6950122714042664
S033	38	1	Let’s all agree, enough of that.	0.6661922335624695
S033	38	2	There are very few solutions that we haven’t thought of.	0.6880626082420349
