Kamala Harris,03:48,"For example, dealing with an issue like price gouging, what we need to do to extend the child tax credit to help young families be able to take care of their children in their most formative years. What we need to do to bring down the cost of housing. My proposal includes what would be a tax credit of $25,000 for first time home buyers. So they can just have enough to put a down payment on a home, which is part of the American Dream and their aspiration, but do it in a way that allows them to actually get on the path to achieving that goal and that dream."
Kamala Harris,01:42,And let me tell you something. The Border Patrol endorsed the bill-
Kamala Harris,03:57,"We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. We have set goals for the United States of America, and by extension the globe, around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as an example. That value has not changed."
Kamala Harris,04:12,"My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed. I spent two terms as the Attorney General of California prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, violations of American laws regarding the illegal passage of guns, drugs, and human beings across our border. My values have not changed."
Kamala Harris,04:32,"So that is the reality of it. And four years of being vice president, I’ll tell you, one of the aspects to your point is traveling the country extensively. I mean, I’m here in Georgia… I think somebody told me 17 times since I’ve been vice president in Georgia alone. I believe it is important to build consensus and it is important to find a common place of understanding of where we can actually solve problems."
Kamala Harris,10:15,"Thank you, Dana. Thank you."
