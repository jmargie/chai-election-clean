Kamala Harris,03:07,"And we worked on supporting what was a bipartisan effort, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, to actually strengthen the border. That border bill would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border, which is why I believe the border patrol agents supported the bill. It would’ve allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States, which is a scourge affecting people of every background, every geographic location in our country, killing people. It would’ve allowed us to put more resources into prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, which I have done-"
Kamala Harris,07:42,"I was just down at the border, talking with border agents and they will tell you, and I’m sure you probably, I know you investigate and you are a serious journalist, they will tell you we need more judges. We need to process those cases faster. We need the support for those cases that should be prosecuted. They need more resources and Congress ultimately is the only place that that’s going to get fixed, Bret. That’s how the system works."
Kamala Harris,15:09,"I, for example, am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington D.C. I invite ideas, whether it be from the Republicans who are supporting me, who were just on stage with me minutes ago, and the business sector and others who can contribute to the decisions that I make about, for example, my plan for increasing the supply of housing in America and bringing down the cost of housing, addressing the issue of small businesses, which is about working with the private sector to bring more capital and access to capital to our small business leaders, including my plan for a $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers and for small businesses, extending the tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000."
Kamala Harris,20:13,"This is a democracy and in a democracy, the president of the United States, in the United States of America should be willing to be able to handle criticism without saying he’d lock people up for doing it. And this is what is at stake, which is why you have someone like the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying what Mark Milley has said about Donald Trump being a threat to the United States of America."
