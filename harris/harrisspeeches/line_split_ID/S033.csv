0,"As of today, we have created over 16 million new jobs, over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. We have the lowest Black unemployment rate in generations. We have invested in small businesses and to the benefit of many people, but including Black small businesses, some of the highest rate of creation of new Black small businesses in years. We have done the work of capping the cost of prescription medication for our seniors for issues like insulin. And again, I’m speaking to the Black journalists who care about all people, but in particular, I’ll talk about the impact on Black people where we know Black folks are 60 times more likely, 60%, excuse me, more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. And we have now finally capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month, capped the cost of prescription medication for our seniors at $2,000 a year because we, unlike the former president who promised to do it, we finally have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices against the big pharmaceutical companies.",S033
1,"And these are just some of the accomplishments. Is the price of groceries still too high? Yes. Do we have more work to do? Yes. And I will tell you, I do believe that I offer a new generation of leadership for our country that is about, in particular turning the page on an era that sadly has shown us attempts by some to incite fear to create division in our country. And to do the work that is about bringing some level of optimism and dare I say, ambition about what I know is possible in our country. And so my plan for the economy includes what I imagine and believe and call an opportunity economy, what we can do to grow an opportunity economy where all people have access to the resources to compete, to apply their incredible work ethic, their ambition, their aspirations, and their dreams. And actually not just get by, but get ahead. And I can talk in more detail about it, but specifically I’ll mention a few things.",S033
2,"One of the big issues that affects people right now in terms of the economy and their economic well-being is we have a shortage of housing supply. It’s too expensive. People can’t afford to buy a home. We grew up our parents where they had the ability to somehow believe the American dream was attainable, not so much for younger working people. And I recognize that, so my approach is a new approach, which is to say, let’s just take this and deal with it head on. And part of my approach is to say, I’m going to employ and engage the private sector, in particular home builders with tax credits to give them the incentive to create new housing, three million by the end of my first term. And understanding that not everybody is handed a silver spoon, but works hard and is trying to save up for a down payment.",S033
3,"Part of my plan, under my opportunity economy is to give first time home buyers a $25,000 down payment assistance so they can just get their foot in the door to be able to then engage in what will prove to be their opportunity to build intergenerational wealth. And here’s my personal experience coming at that. I grew up a middle class kid. My mother was hardworking. She raised me and my sister, Maya. She saved up. And it was only by the time I was a teenager that she could afford to actually buy her first home. And I know and I identify with it, I know where I come from.",S033
4,"But I want to also get back to the earlier point that you made about extending the child tax credit, so part of my new approach is we need to expand the child tax credit. And so part of my plan that is under an opportunity economy is to extend and expand the child tax credit to $6,000 so that young families in particular for the first year of their child’s life, which is an extraordinarily important time in their development, have the resources to be able to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy children’s clothing, and not have to worry about whether they’re going to be able to meet their other needs. And I don’t need to remind anybody here, especially these esteemed journalists, but when we expanded the child tax credit a couple of years ago, we reduced Black child poverty by half. And so again, if you talk about the benefit and if you think about the benefit to the economy overall, it strengthens our economy to do things like pay attention to affordable child care, affordable home healthcare, and extending the child tax credit.",S033
5,"I appreciate the spirit of the question, but I’ll tell you, I’ve often been asked this question in a way that I’ve had to respond by first saying that",S033
6,"So my work has included as Vice President getting billions more dollars into community banks, including working with the big banks to do that, so that we can increase access to capital for our small businesses, for our startups. Part of my plan under my economic opportunity plan going forward is that right now start up entrepreneurs, small businesses only get a tax deduction of $5,000. Nobody can start a small business with $5,000. So I’m expanding that to $50,000. Understanding again, that when people have the opportunity to have the resources to get started, they’re going to put the good ideas, they’re going to put the hard work into it. And part of what I also know is that our young black men, our black men, just like any group of people, anybody, our small businesses are really the backbone of our economy overall. And when they do better economically, we all do better.",S033
7,"Part of my work is about understanding what we need to do in dealing with, for example, the historic inequities that have faced the black community around home-ownership. I don’t have to go through the history with anybody here about what that has meant in terms of redlining, what that has meant in terms of biases and home appraisals, and the impact it has had on stemming the opportunity to build intergenerational wealth because of those obstacles. So part of the work that I have done and will continue to do is identify, speak truth about those obstacles and address them. Another example is medical debt. One in four black families or individuals is more likely to carry medical debt than others. So part of my perspective, and as Vice President, part of the work that we have done is to say that we’re going to eliminate medical debt from being on your credit score.",S033
8,"Because until now, medical debt worked against your credit score, and people know their credit score like you know your weight. You know that number. And the difference between what that number is and what it needs to be is the difference between you being able to get a car loan, a small business loan, or even a lease on an apartment. And so part of my approach is understanding the obstacles that traditionally and currently exist to allow anyone, including black men, be able to achieve economic wealth. And I’m going to tell you, I don’t think it is sufficient to just only talk about economic policy around reducing unemployment. It is an important marker. And I’m proud of the work that we’ve done thus far. But it should be a baseline there, everybody’s working. The point is, do people have an opportunity to build wealth if that’s what they choose to do, if that’s what they want to do.",S033
9,"And a lot of my perspective as we go forward is just that. I believe that there are a lot of opportunities that are available to the American people if we just see people, and understand what they want for themselves and their families, and then meet them where they are.",S033
10,"Well, first of all, as you mentioned, Sheila Jackson Lee, she",S033
11,"But part of what we can do right now is, for example, what I’m talking about in terms of building an opportunity economy. Which is addressing explicitly the obstacles that historically and currently exist and dealing with them. Student loan debt, medical debt, bias in home appraisals. What we need to do in terms of dealing with an issue that I have championed for years, black maternal mortality, which is the fact that black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women. And we know that the reasons for that include disparities that pre-exist her pregnancy, including disparities that exist in the system during her pregnancy. So all of those things must be addressed.",S033
12,"As Attorney general of California, fifth-largest economy in the world, I was acutely aware that my words could move markets. When you are bestowed with a microphone that is that big, there is a profound responsibility that comes with that. That is an extension of what should not be lost in this moment. This concept of the public trust to then understand what the public trust means, it means that you have been invested with trust to be responsible in the way you use your words, much less how you conduct yourself. And especially when you have been and then seek to be again, President of the United States of America.",S033
13,"And so I go back to it’s a crying shame, literally. What’s happening to those families, those children in that community, not to mention what is happening in terms of… Look, you say you care about law enforcement, law enforcement resources, being put into this because of these serious threats that are being issued against a community that is living a productive good life before this happened. And spewing lies that are grounded in tropes that are age-old. And look, I said it not very far from here the other day at the debate. This is not new. This is not new in terms of these tropes. This is not new in terms of where it’s coming from and whether it is refusing to rent to people, rent to black families, whether it is taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times against five innocent Black and Latino teenagers, The Central Park Five calling for their execution, whether it is referring to the first black President of the United States with a lie, [inaudible 00:31:39] their lies.",S033
14,"And look, the American people deserve, and I do believe want better than this. I do believe that. I know, I know the vast majority of us as Americans know, we have so much more in common than what separates us. I know that. I know that regardless of someone’s background, their race, their gender, their geographic location, I know that people are deeply troubled by what is happening to that community in Springfield, Ohio. And it’s got to stop. And we’ve got to say that you cannot be entrusted with standing behind the seal of the President of the United States of America engaging in that hateful rhetoric that as usual is designed to divide us as a country, is designed to have people pointing fingers at each other.",S033
15,"It’s designed to do that. And I think most people in our country, regardless of their race, are starting to see through this nonsense and to say, you know what? Let’s turn the page on this. This is exhausting and it’s harmful and it’s hateful and grounded in some age-old stuff that we should not have the tolerance for. So let’s turn the page and chart a new way forward and say you can’t have that microphone again.",S033
16,"Which is why I also have been very adamant for years. In fact, I myself protested at a gun show probably 10, 15 years ago about the gun show loophole and why we need to close that. Because what ends up happening is that gun shows at flea markets, gun dealers are not under existing law in the past required to register their sales. And so you are exactly right that a lot of homicides, for example, a good number of them, I don’t have the statistic in front of my mind, are committed with illegally purchased guns. And that’s why we need to address each entry point in the issue, including universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole,",S033
17,"And we must take it seriously, in every way, understanding it’s not just about a soundbite. It’s about a comprehensive approach that deals with the tragedy of, to your point, everyday gun violence in America. It’s real. It has had a profound impact in terms of trauma that for the most part has gone undiagnosed and untreated. The trauma that exists in communities around the violence of losing their children, losing a brother, losing a father, an uncle. All of that must be addressed and we have to have a holistic response to it.",S033
18,"It’s about understanding what we need to do to, again, understand that, to your point, we have to have a holistic response to this issue and prioritize it instead of reacting to the tragedy that, sadly, they are too predictable.
