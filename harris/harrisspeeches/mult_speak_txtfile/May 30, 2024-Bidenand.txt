Speaker: Joe Biden (10:55):
Text: It’s good.

Speaker: President Joe Biden (11:00):
Text: It’s good to be almost home. I just live down the road a little bit. Thank you, Kamala, for your partnership. And it is a partnership. And how about another round of applause for our great vice president? Isn’t she something else?
Text: (11:18)It’s great to see so many friends, including my fellow Scrantonian Senator Bobby Casey. Bobby, where are you? There you are. Mayor Parker; Lieutenant Governor Davis; and Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Steve Horsford; members of the CBC who are here tonight, I’m a… If I introduce everybody, I’ll be here all night.
Text: (11:40)But, look, while he couldn’t be here, thinking of our dear friend Congressman Dwight Evans. He’s recovering. He’s going to recover. He’s doing well. And joining us are so many state and local officials from across the country, including the guy from my father’s hometown, where he was born, Baltimore, Maryland. They say it down Baltimore, not Baltimore. I want to introduce you to the mayor of… The mayor… The governor of the great state of Maryland. Where are you, Gov? In case you haven’t noticed, he looks like he can still play too. It’s great to be with you, Gov.
Text: (12:26)Civil rights and community leaders from all across the country, folks, if anyone wonders whether their vote matters, remember this: Because Black America voted in 2020… Please have a seat, if you can. Have a seat. Because Black Americans voted, Kamala and I are President and Vice President of the United States because of you. That’s not hyperbole. Because you voted, Donald Trump is a defeated former president. And with your vote in 2024, we’re going to make Donald Trump a loser again.
Text: (13:14)In 2020, throughout my career, and a lot of Philadelphians know this because I got so much help when I was running for the Senate in Delaware from Philly, Black voters placed enormous faith in me. I’ve tried to do my best to honor that trust, staying true to the value set that we share, got me involved as a kid in the first place.
Text: (13:34)Everyone’s entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Faith and family are everything, and we leave no one behind. But, folks, I know it’s natural to wonder if democracy, democracy you hear about actually works for you. When justice is denied, how can it be working for you? When promises are broken, how can it be working you? When you have to be 10 times better than everyone else to get the same shot, how can it be working for you? I get it. And I know there’s a lot of misinformation out there. So I came today to speak the truth. The truth about promises made and promises kept.
Text: (14:21)Do you remember when the pandemic hit, when 20 million people were out of work, when businesses and school shut down, emergency rooms were overwhelmed and Black folks were hit harder than anyone else? When Trump was president, he said, and he said this, he took responsibility for none of it. He said, “It’s none of my responsibility.” When I came to office, I promised we’d do everything we can to get us through that pandemic, and that’s what we did. That, folks, was a promise made and a promise kept.
Text: (14:55)I promised to put racial equality at the center of everything I do because I vowed I would have an administration that looked like America. Because you voted, we’re invested more than ever in the Black families and communities. A promise made and a promise kept. A promise we’d start to reconnect Black and brown and overlooked neighborhoods cut off by highways in the ’60s and decades of disinvestment as a consequence of it, including here in Philly. Well, we’re changing that with the Recovery Act right now, you see all the construction going on in the highways around here. A promise made and a promise kept.
Text: (15:37)Look, I said I’d remove every lead pipe in America because every child can drink clean water without fear of brain damage. We’re doing it. A promise made and a promise kept. I promised we’d also take the most significant action on environmental justice ever, to remove the legacy of pollution that smothers fence lined communities. Because every child, every American deserves to breathe clean and fresh air. We’re doing it. A promise made and a promise kept.
Text: (16:05)I promised to access affordable high speed internet because now internet is just as important as it was in the days of Franklin Roosevelt, electricity was generations ago. We’re delivering now because no child should have to do their homework at McDonald’s when things are shut down, sit in the parking lot with their parent to get it done. Another promise made and another promise kept.
Text: (16:27)I promised to protect your healthcare. I protected and expanded the Affordable Healthcare Act, what was Obamacare, is still Obamacare, saving millions of Americans additional $800 a year in premiums. And folks, the Affordable Care Act is still a big deal. As Kamala just explained, Senators debated this, but we finally got it done. Seniors with diabetes are now paying $35 for insulin instead of 400. I’m determined to make that apply to every American, not just seniors in the second term.
Text: (17:15)We’re capping… The bill we’ve already passed would cap total out-of-pocket costs for drugs for seniors beginning next year at $2,000 a year total, including cancer drugs that cost 10, 12, $14,000 a year. You’re paying no more than $2,000 a year. A promise made and a promise kept. And by the way, not only saves people money, it saves the taxpayers, guess what? $160 billion cut in the deficit because Medicare doesn’t have to pay those exorbitant prices.
Text: (17:49)Folks, one of the reasons I got started and won the first time and subsequent times in Delaware is because of the best HBCU in America, Delaware State. Kamala says there’s some school down in Washington… Anyway, HBCUs are incredible institutions, but they don’t have the same endowments as other universities to fund research centers and do so much more. Because you voted, I kept my commitment. We’re investing $16 billion, the most ever in the history of America, $16 billion. Will grow America, will save America money. A promise made and a promise kept.
Text: (18:44)I’m keeping my promises that no one should be in jail merely for using or possessing marijuana. I pardoned thousands of people incarcerated for the mere possession of marijuana, thousands. A promise made and a promise kept. And their records should be expunged as well, I might add.
Text: (19:09)Folks, it wasn’t easy to get a lot of this done. In fact, obstacles every step of the way we faced. For example, Senate Republicans blocked the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, but didn’t stop me from signing historic executive order requiring key elements of that bill for federal enforcement. That is banning chokeholds, greatly restricting no-knock warrants, creating databases for police misconduct and so much more. But we’re still… And we did it with the support of George Floyd’s family and we’re going to finally get it all done. A promise made and a promise kept.
Text: (19:42)I promised we’d beat the NRA and we did. As Kamala mentioned, I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. A promise made and a promise kept. By the way, I’m going to go back and once again ban assault weapons in America. I did it once; we’ll do it again.
Text: (20:04)Supreme Court blocked me from relieving student debt, but they didn’t stop me. So far I’ve relieved student debt for nearly five million Americans. A significant number are Black borrowers. So you can chase your dream, start a family, buy your first home, start a business, and so much more. And guess what? It grows the economy. It strengthens the economy. I’m going to keep it going. A promise made is a promise kept.
Text: (20:33)And we’re speaking of the courts. Because you voted, I was able to keep my commitment to appoint the first Black woman on the United States Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. A promise made and a promise kept. And I appointed more Black women in the federal circuit courts than every other president in American history combined, every single president combined. Overall, we appointed 200 Black judges to the federal bench. And guess what? The next president, they’re going to be able to appoint a couple justices and I’ll be damned if they’re not going to…
Text: (21:12)Look, if in fact we’re able to change some of the justices when they retire and put in really progressive judges like we’ve always had. Tell me that won’t change your life when Trump justices are already gutting voting rights, overturning Roe, decimating affirmative action and so much more. Are we going to let that happen? We can’t. No, we really can’t.
Text: (21:41)Now, let’s talk about Trump’s MAGA lies. I don’t have an hour, but we’re going to [inaudible 00:21:48]. Trump takes credit for sending all the pandemic relief checks alone. It’s a lie. Truth is the Congressional Black Caucus got that money passed.
------
Speaker: President Joe Biden (22:00):
Text: And when Kamala came to office, with the help of the CDC, passed legislation that delivered more checks in the pockets of millions of Americans, including Black Americans. $1,400 checks from the American Rescue Plan we passed, and then, $300 a month per child, per family, through the Child Tax Credit, which cut child poverty in half for Black families. And I’m going to get it reinstated in the second term. Folks, Trump continues to lie by saying Black unemployment was at a record low on his watch. The fact is record low unemployment happened on my watch, and we’re going to keep it going.
Text: (22:43)Black small businesses are starting up at a faster rate in 30 years because of what we’ve done. The racial wealth gap is the lowest it’s been in 20 years because of our efforts. A promise made and a promise kept. I announced most significant housing plan in 50 years. It includes first time home buyers tax credit, building millions of affordable housing to bring rents down. New data shows 40% cut in the gap between home appraisals in majority white communities versus those communities of color. You know, the same exact builder on either side of 95 build the same houses. If it’s a Black community, the value, from the very day it’s built, ends up being lower than the exact same house across the highway in the white community. We’re doing everything we can to right that wrong. And guess what? We’re taking on corporate greed to bring down the price of gas, food, and rent, eliminating junk fees. Instead of getting charged 35 bucks for an overdraft, it’s $3 now, not 35.
Text: (23:54)The bottom line is we’ve invested more in Black America than any previous administration in history has. We open more doors for economic opportunity, including access to capital, entrepreneurship, workforce training, so you can build a life of financial freedom and create generational wealth, all, all while being the providers and leaders of your families and community. Another promise made and a promise kept. We’re just getting started. The second term, want to keep it going to level the playing field by making the wealthy begin to pay their fair tax. It ain’t even close. I said I’d not increase the tax of anybody making less than $ 400,000 a year.
Text: (24:32)Well, guess how much the average federal tax rate is for a billionaire? We have thousand of them. 8.3%, 8.3%. It’s outrageous. If the billionaires only had to pay 25% to raise four hundred billion dollars, we’d be able to do everything we’re doing now and still reduce the debt. Look, billionaires pay their fair share, not only reduce the deficit, but could provide childcare, elder care, paid leave, and so much more, to change the lives of millions of Americans, as well as grow our economy. But folks, all progress, all freedom, all opportunities at risk. Trump is trying to make the country forget just how dark and unsettling things were when he was president, but we’ll never forget lying around and him lying around actually and lying about how serious the pandemic was and say he had no responsibility for it and telling Americans, “Just inject a little bleach.” Remember that? [inaudible 00:25:46] and I think he injected a hell of a lot of bleach in himself.
Text: (25:53)Trump, you got it, kid, Trump and his MAGA extremists want to give power back to big pharma, to continue to charge exorbitant fees. Trump is still determined, in his own words, “to terminate the Affordable Care Act,” which will deny 3 million Black Americans health insurance, deny protections for preexisting conditions for millions more. During his presidency, Trump enacted a $2 trillion tax cut, overwhelmingly benefiting the very wealthy and the biggest corporations, and exploded the federal deficit. He racked up more federal debt than any president did in any presidential term in history.
Text: (26:36)Tell me about the Republicans in balance and budgets. And now, he wants to do it again. At the same time, he’s determined to cut Social Security and Medicare. I have a better idea, let’s protect Social Security, Medicare, and make the very wealthy begin to pay for it. As Kamala said, Trump brags about gutting Roe v. Wade, standing there, “I did this,” while he openly encourages voter suppression and election subversion. Folks, reelect Kamala and me and a Democratic Congress, and I will sign the John Lewis Voting Right Act and the Freedom to Vote Act tomorrow. And we will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again.
Text: (27:24)It’s within our power to do this. MAGA extremists banned books. Did you ever think, if you’re anybody over 30 years old, you’d go through a period where banning books in America? They’re trying to erase Black history. We’re going to write Black history, because it’s American history. It’s American history. Together, we make history, not erase it. To me, the values of diversity, equality, and inclusion are literally, and that’s not kidding, the core strengths of America. That’s why I’m proud to have the most diverse administration in history, that taps into the full talents of our country and starts at the top with the Vice President.
Text: (28:07)On Memorial Day, I proudly stood with a Black man, the highest order of the first Black Secretary of Defense, second Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Black women heads of military units were overseeing the most diverse, strongest fighting force in the history of the world. And folks, the threat that Trump poses is greater in his second term than his first. It’s clear that, when he lost in 2020, something literally snapped in this guy. No, I’m serious. That’s why January 6th happened, when he unleashed an insurrection. Now, he’s running again, and he’s clearly unhinged.
Text: (28:54)He calls insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol patriots. Patriots. If reelected, he wants to pardon, “every one of them.” Let me ask you, what do you think he would’ve done on January 6th if Black Americans had stormed it? Think about this, what do you think would’ve happened if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol? I don’t think he’d be talking about pardons. It’s the same guy who wanted to tear gas you, as you peacefully protested George Floyd’s murder, the same guy who still calls the Central Park 5 guilty, even though they’re exonerated. He’s that landlord who denies housing applications because of the color of your skin. He’s that guy who won’t say, “Black Lives Matter, and invokes Neo-Nazi Third Reich terms. We all remember Trump is the same guy who unleashed birtherism, the birtherism law against Barack. And then, Trump tells you he’s the greatest president, I love this one, he says he’s the greatest president for Black people in the history of America, including more than Abraham Lincoln.

Speaker: Crowd (30:09):
Text: Boo.
------
Speaker: President Joe Biden (30:18):
Text: Can you fathom that? Like I said, I think he injected too much of that bleach in his brain. I think it affected his brain. Some lies are so foolish you don’t have to say anything about them at all. Maya Angelou said, “When someone shows you who they are-”
------
Speaker: Crowd (30:41):
Text: “Believe them.”
------
Speaker: President Joe Biden (30:42):
Text: “Believe them the first time,” you got it, kid. You got it. I’ve shown you who I am, and Trump has shown you who he is. And today, Donald Trump is pandering and peddling lies and stereotypes for your vote, so he can win, for himself, not for you. Well, Donald Trump, we’ll have a message for you, not in our house and not in our watch. Let me close with this.
Text: (31:16)Let me close with this. Folks, I know we have a lot more to do. When the full promise of America is not available to every person in this country, regardless of race, we’ve got work to do. But let’s not lose sight how far we’ve come. And the reason is you. The stakes in this selection couldn’t be higher. What’s at stake is nothing less than the fundamental ideal of America, defines America, that we’re all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, and should be treated that way throughout our lives. We’ve never lived up to it, but we’ve never, ever before completely walked away from it either.
Text: (31:54)And I’ll be damned if I’m going to let Donald Trump be the reason to stop being America. I’ll be damned if I’m going to let Donald Trump, we’re not going to let Donald Trump turn America into a place that doesn’t believe in honesty, decency, and treating people with respect. And I’ll be damned if I’m going to let Donald Trump turn America into a place filled with anger and resentment and hate. Folks, America’s always been a place where we work toward more perfect union, where those who are excluded in the past are included in the promise of the country today. I still believe that. I’m still optimistic, but I need you. So my question for you is simple, a simple one, are you with me? Talk to your family.
------
Speaker: President Joe Biden (33:00):
Text: … family.
Text: (33:12)Spread the word. As the gospel song goes, “We’ve come too far from where we started. Nobody told me the road would be easy. I don’t believe he brought me this far though to leave me.” My fellow Americans, I don’t think the good Lord brought us this far to leave us behind. We just have to remember who we are. We’re the United States of America, and there’s nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we act together. God bless you all and may God protect our truth. Thank you. Thank you.
Text: (34:26)Every time I’d walk out of my grandfather fitting his house up in Scranton, he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.” And my grandmother would go, “No, Joey. Spread it. Go spread the faith.”

Speaker: Joe Biden (10:31):

Speaker: President Joe Biden (11:00):
Text: It’s good to be almost home. I just live down the road a little bit. Thank you, Kamala, for your partnership. And it is a partnership. And how about another round of applause for our great vice president? Isn’t she something else?
Text: (11:18)It’s great to see so many friends, including my fellow Scrantonian Senator Bobby Casey. Bobby, where are you? There you are. Mayor Parker; Lieutenant Governor Davis; and Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Steve Horsford; members of the CBC who are here tonight, I’m a… If I introduce everybody, I’ll be here all night.
Text: (11:40)But, look, while he couldn’t be here, thinking of our dear friend Congressman Dwight Evans. He’s recovering. He’s going to recover. He’s doing well. And joining us are so many state and local officials from across the country, including the guy from my father’s hometown, where he was born, Baltimore, Maryland. They say it down Baltimore, not Baltimore. I want to introduce you to the mayor of… The mayor… The governor of the great state of Maryland. Where are you, Gov? In case you haven’t noticed, he looks like he can still play too. It’s great to be with you, Gov.

But, folks, I know it’s natural to wonder if democracy, democracy you hear about actually works for you. When justice is denied, how can it be working for you?

It strengthens the economy. I’m going to keep it going. A promise made is a promise kept.

A promise made and a promise kept. And I appointed more Black women in the federal circuit courts than every other president in American history combined, every single president combined.

Tell me that won’t change your life when Trump justices are already gutting voting rights, overturning Roe, decimating affirmative action and so much more. Are we going to let that happen? We can’t. No, we really can’t.

Trump is still determined, in his own words, “to terminate the Affordable Care Act,” which will deny 3 million Black Americans health insurance, deny protections for preexisting conditions for millions more. During his presidency, Trump enacted a $2 trillion tax cut, overwhelmingly benefiting the very wealthy and the biggest corporations, and exploded the federal deficit. He racked up more federal debt than any president did in any presidential term in history.
Text: (26:36)Tell me about the Republicans in balance and budgets. And now, he wants to do it again. At the same time, he’s determined to cut Social Security and Medicare. I have a better idea, let’s protect Social Security, Medicare, and make the very wealthy begin to pay for it. As Kamala said, Trump brags about gutting Roe v. Wade, standing there, “I did this,” while he openly encourages voter suppression and election subversion. Folks, reelect Kamala and me and a Democratic Congress, and I will sign the John Lewis Voting Right Act and the Freedom to Vote Act tomorrow. And we will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again.
Text: (27:24)It’s within our power to do this. MAGA extremists banned books. Did you ever think, if you’re anybody over 30 years old, you’d go through a period where banning books in America? They’re trying to erase Black history. We’re going to write Black history, because it’s American history. It’s American history. Together, we make history, not erase it. To me, the values of diversity, equality, and inclusion are literally, and that’s not kidding, the core strengths of America. That’s why I’m proud to have the most diverse administration in history, that taps into the full talents of our country and starts at the top with the Vice President.
Text: (28:07)On Memorial Day, I proudly stood with a Black man, the highest order of the first Black Secretary of Defense, second Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Black women heads of military units were overseeing the most diverse, strongest fighting force in the history of the world. And folks, the threat that Trump poses is greater in his second term than his first. It’s clear that, when he lost in 2020, something literally snapped in this guy. No, I’m serious. That’s why January 6th happened, when he unleashed an insurrection. Now, he’s running again, and he’s clearly unhinged.
Text: (28:54)He calls insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol patriots. Patriots. If reelected, he wants to pardon, “every one of them.” Let me ask you, what do you think he would’ve done on January 6th if Black Americans had stormed it? Think about this, what do you think would’ve happened if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol? I don’t think he’d be talking about pardons. It’s the same guy who wanted to tear gas you, as you peacefully protested George Floyd’s murder, the same guy who still calls the Central Park 5 guilty, even though they’re exonerated. He’s that landlord who denies housing applications because of the color of your skin. He’s that guy who won’t say, “Black Lives Matter, and invokes Neo-Nazi Third Reich terms. We all remember Trump is the same guy who unleashed birtherism, the birtherism law against Barack. And then, Trump tells you he’s the greatest president, I love this one, he says he’s the greatest president for Black people in the history of America, including more than Abraham Lincoln.

Speaker: President Joe Biden (30:18):
Text: Can you fathom that? Like I said, I think he injected too much of that bleach in his brain. I think it affected his brain. Some lies are so foolish you don’t have to say anything about them at all. Maya Angelou said, “When someone shows you who they are-”

Speaker: Crowd (30:41):
Text: “Believe them.”

Speaker: President Joe Biden (30:42):
Text: “Believe them the first time,” you got it, kid. You got it. I’ve shown you who I am, and Trump has shown you who he is. And today, Donald Trump is pandering and peddling lies and stereotypes for your vote, so he can win, for himself, not for you. Well, Donald Trump, we’ll have a message for you, not in our house and not in our watch. Let me close with this.
Text: (31:16)Let me close with this. Folks, I know we have a lot more to do. When the full promise of America is not available to every person in this country, regardless of race, we’ve got work to do. But let’s not lose sight how far we’ve come. And the reason is you. The stakes in this selection couldn’t be higher. What’s at stake is nothing less than the fundamental ideal of America, defines America, that we’re all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, and should be treated that way throughout our lives. We’ve never lived up to it, but we’ve never, ever before completely walked away from it either.
Text: (31:54)And I’ll be damned if I’m going to let Donald Trump be the reason to stop being America. I’ll be damned if I’m going to let Donald Trump, we’re not going to let Donald Trump turn America into a place that doesn’t believe in honesty, decency, and treating people with respect. And I’ll be damned if I’m going to let Donald Trump turn America into a place filled with anger and resentment and hate. Folks, America’s always been a place where we work toward more perfect union, where those who are excluded in the past are included in the promise of the country today. I still believe that. I’m still optimistic, but I need you. So my question for you is simple, a simple one, are you with me? Talk to your family.

Speaker: President Joe Biden (33:00):
Text: … family.
Text: (33:12)Spread the word. As the gospel song goes, “We’ve come too far from where we started. Nobody told me the road would be easy. I don’t believe he brought me this far though to leave me.” My fellow Americans, I don’t think the good Lord brought us this far to leave us behind. We just have to remember who we are. We’re the United States of America, and there’s nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we act together. God bless you all and may God protect our truth. Thank you. Thank you.
Text: (34:26)Every time I’d walk out of my grandfather fitting his house up in Scranton, he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.” And my grandmother would go, “No, Joey. Spread it. Go spread the faith.”
