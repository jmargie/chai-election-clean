Text: (01:10)Wisconsin, we have just 90 days to make sure that we elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, and send them to the White House. And our work together begins here today. At the top of the ticket, we’ve got that incredible Vice President, Kamala Harris. She has spent the last four years vigorously defending our democracy, fighting to protect the freedoms that we hold dear, and very tirelessly working to do the right thing and deliver for us.
Text: (01:47)Then you have my good friend and our next-door neighbor, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. And Wisconsin, you know what happens when you elect a former teacher, don’t you? We go hog wild getting things done. We always do what’s best for our kids and working families. We work to find common ground and consensus, and we lead with kindness, respect, and compassion. And those are the exact Midwestern values, qualities, and work ethic that will make Tim a great vice president. And folks, I’m so excited about this iconic duo. Kamala and Tim go together like custard and curds, like cream puffs and the state fair, like old fashioned and french fries, polka and euchre, brats and beer. So, I’m going to ask you, Wisconsin, are you all in to win?
------
Speaker: Crowd (03:05):
Text: Yeah!
------
Speaker: Tony Evers (03:08):
Text: Good, because we have a hell of a lot of work to do. We have 90 days, and we do not have a minute to waste, because here’s the truth about the other two jokers in this race. Donald Trump and J. D. Vance are a dangerous threat to our country and our democracy. They’re not running to help others, folks. They’re running to serve themselves. They’re not capable of the truth or telling it. And Donald Trump and J. D. Vance have a radical agenda that they plan to pursue if they get to the office. Obviously, you’ve googled Project 2025, right?
------
Speaker: Crowd (03:54):
Text: Yeah.
------
Speaker: Tony Evers (03:55):
Text: Seriously, look it up if you haven’t when you get home. We all know that Donald Trump and J. D. Vance will work to enact a national abortion ban. His running mate, J. D. Vance, said he’d like abortion to be, quote, “illegal nationally”. I think Wisconsin women will have something to say about that. Women here in Wisconsin already spent a year experiencing what it is like to live in a state that bans nearly all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest. And you know what we’re going to tell Donald Trump, J. D. Vance, and the Republicans up and down the ballot on November 5th? Which is my birthday. We are not going back.
------
Speaker: Crowd (04:52):
Text: We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back.

Speaker: Tony Evers (04:58):

------
Speaker: Crowd (05:13):
Text: Thank you, Tony!
------
Speaker: Tony Evers (05:13):
Text: We have a choice between those who want to conquer by dividing, and people who will build by unifying. We have a choice between those who want to turn back the past and people who want to go forward to a better future. Folks, we have 90 days, Wisconsin. Let’s make them count. Let’s get to work. Let’s go win this damn thing. Let’s win! Thank you!

Text: Please welcome United States Senator Tammy Baldwin.
------
Speaker: MUSIC (06:39):
Text: Ain’t no stoppin’ us now.
Text: (06:44)We’re on the move.
Text: (06:44)Ain’t no stoppin’ us now.
Text: (06:51)We’ve got the groove.
------
Speaker: Tammy Baldwin (07:08):
Text: Hello, Wisconsin! I am so proud to be here today. Today, as we stand here, we mark a new beginning for our party and our country as we welcome our presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, back to our state. Now, as California Attorney General, Kamala Harris was the top prosecutor for the largest state in the nation, standing up for the rule of law and taking on perpetrators of all kinds, which is exactly the kind of experience that will come in handy at a moment like this. As a United States senator, I was always riveted to watch her, on the Judiciary Committee, hold the powerful to account. And as vice president, she fought fervently to restore reproductive freedom after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. I am so proud to support Kamala for president of the United States.
Text: (08:25)And so I also want to recognize the next vice president of the United States, Governor Tim Walz. As a military veteran, a teacher, and a true public servant, he is a fantastic addition to the Democratic ticket. Now, when he and I served in the House of Representatives together, we worked together to stand up for our dairy farmers. And while serving as governor of our neighboring state, Minnesota, we worked together to bring $1 billion for a new bridge in Superior, Wisconsin that’ll connect our two states, create jobs, bolster our economy, and make sure our families can get to work on time.
Text: (09:22)In picking a fellow Midwesterner, it is clear that this campaign knows that the path to the presidency, and to control of the United States Senate, runs directly through the Midwest. And that means it runs directly through Wisconsin, because we are the battleground state. Wisconsin is likely to decide who our next president is, and who controls the United States Senate. And Wisconsin, speaking of that US Senate seat, I’m being challenged by a self-funding multimillionaire by the name of Eric Hovde.
------
Speaker: Crowd (10:06):
Text: Boo!
------
Speaker: Tammy Baldwin (10:11):
Text: Now, Hovde owns a $3 billion California bank, a $7 million ocean view home in Laguna Beach, and he’s been named one of the influential residents of Orange County three years in a row. Folks, we have a Green County, Wisconsin, we have a Brown County, Wisconsin, but there’s no Orange County, Wisconsin. And you may laugh at that, but the stakes of this race are really high. Hovde celebrated when Roe was overturned. He said he’s 100% anti-choice. Meanwhile, I am leading the effort to restore reproductive freedoms with my Women’s Health Protection Act. On healthcare, my opponent wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and kick millions off of their health insurance. Living without health insurance throughout my youth, due to a childhood illness, is why I got into public service to begin with. I wrote the provision in the Affordable Care Act that allows young people to stay on their parents’ insurance until they turn 26. And I will never stop fighting until all Americans have the quality affordable healthcare they need and deserve. On the economy, Eric Hovde wants to cut Social Security and Medicare, while giving new tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy and well-connected, like himself. As your senator, I will always fight to bring down costs for working families, and make sure that multi-millionaires, like my opponent, pay their fair share.
Text: (12:14)Now, with Eric Hovde, it’s more than just the issues. He’s insulted just about everyone in our state. He’s called farmers “lazy”. He said seniors in nursing homes shouldn’t have the right to vote. He told kids of single moms that they’re likely to be poor and on drugs. He even said that people who are struggling with their weight should pay more for their health insurance. Can you believe it? It’s clear that he has spent more time on his private beach in California than on a factory floor or a family farm here in Wisconsin. We need to defeat him, not only to protect the rights and freedoms that we hold dear, not only to continue to deliver for working families, but because Wisconsinites actually deserve a senator who understands them, not one who insults them.

Text: (01:16:40)‘Cause there’s a spark in you.

Text: (01:16:40)If you only knew what the future holds.
Text: (01:17:45)After a hurricane comes a rainbow.
Text: (01:17:49)Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed.
Text: (01:17:53)So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road.
Text: (01:17:55)Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow.
Text: (01:17:55)And when it’s time, you’ll know.
Text: (01:17:55)You just gotta ignite the light.
Text: (01:17:55)And let it shine.

Speaker: Les Danielson (01:24:14):
Text: Good afternoon. My name is Les Danielson and I’m a fourth generation farmer, born and raised in Cadott. I’ve been farming right here in the Chippewa Valley my entire life. In 1884, my great-grandfather, Dan Danielson, moved to the Chippewa Valley and homesteaded our original farm.
Text: (01:24:34)My grandfather, William, continued on with a family farm, followed by my father, Wayne. Today, my two brothers and I all farm in the same area in Cadott, just over 20 minutes from here. My extended family still farms the same land my great-grandparents did, and we look forward to farming it for years to come. My wife, Debra and I, purchased 700 acres of our own land and now grow 500 acres of corn, soybeans, and some hay. We built our grain setup and milk a small herd of cows.
Text: (01:25:08)My story’s a Wisconsin story, one of hard work and perseverance, and that’s why I’m glad and excited that Vice President Harris’ running mate is a lifelong Midwesterner, just like me, who’ll always fight for working families and understands rural America. As a kid from Cadott, I’m very proud to stand on this stage today as we welcome the next President and Vice President of the United States to the Chippewa Valley.
Text: (01:25:48)Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz know that rural America is the backbone of our nation. It’s family farms like mine that feed our country and it’s small businesses in towns like Cadott that keep our economy strong. But while Donald Trump was in office, my brothers and I saw firsthand his disastrous trade wars and economic policies, which left many farmers, like us, struggling, and devastated small and mid-sized grain farms.
Text: (01:26:24)Trump stands on the side of Big Ag, Big Oil, and giant corporations, not family farms. And he made it harder for us to compete. Together with President Biden, Kamala Harris has fought for rural communities, whether it’s through fixing our roads and bridges so we can get products to markets or fighting to expand affordable healthcare or helping family farms like mine.
Text: (01:26:55)Donald Trump and JD fans just don’t care about rural America, no matter how much they pretend to. That’s why this November, I’m voting for Kamala Harris and Governor Walz. And now it’s my honor to introduce our future vice president, Governor Tim Walz.

Text: In the day we sweat it out on the streets.
Text: (01:27:16)Of a runaway American dream.
Text: (01:27:16)At night we ride through the mansions of glory.
Text: (01:27:16)In suicide machines.

Speaker: Tim Walz (01:28:06):
Text: Wow. Wow. Wow. Hello, Eau Claire. Isn’t it good to have a candidate who can pronounce the name correctly? Wow. Les, thank you. Thank you for the introduction. More importantly, thank you for articulating what we know it means to live out here in the Midwest: care for your neighbors, kindness.
Text: (01:28:37)I want to acknowledge a few people today. Somebody who I have to tell you might be the kindest human being I have ever met. Your governor, Tony Evers. A dear friend of mine who I had a chance to serve with in the House of Representatives, an incredible senator, Tammy Baldwin. The people’s lawyer, your Attorney General Josh Kaul. And someone who knows education’s a foundation of everything, State Superintendent Jill Underly. All the state and local officials are here, but I want to say that, putting a personal privilege on this, I got a bunch of my family down here in the front, so… A couple of them are Badgers too, by the way, so.
Text: (01:29:53)And a real special thank you to everybody here. Looking out across here, look, you’re busy people. You got things to do. It’s a summer day. You had to walk two miles. I had nothing to do with that, by the way, nothing. But you came here for one beautiful, simple reason. You love this country and this democracy.
Text: (01:30:22)I couldn’t be prouder to be on this ticket to help make Kamala Harris the next President of the United States. You know it. Vice President Harris is on the side of the American people. She took on predators, fraudsters, transnational gang members. She stood up against powerful corporate interests and she never hesitated, not once, to reach across the aisle if it improved people’s lives.
Text: (01:30:57)Being a Midwesterner, too, I know a little something about commitment to people. I was born in a small town in Nebraska where community meant everything. My mom and dad taught me to show generosity to my neighbors and work for a common good. At 17, I joined the Army National Guard. For 24 years, I proudly wore the uniform of this nation.
Text: (01:31:27)And that service, just as it did for my dad, a Korean War veteran, and millions of others, I got the GI Bill and it gave me a shot at a college education. My dad was a teacher. My siblings were all teachers. And three of them married teachers. It’s noble work. I had the privilege of teaching public school social studies and coaching football for 20 years. And for all you Packers and Badgers fans, yes, we did win a state championship, so it’s what we do.
Text: (01:32:14)But it was my students who encouraged me to run for office. I never thought that much about it, but they saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them. This idea of a commitment to a better world, a common good, a belief that one single person can actually make a difference.
Text: (01:32:39)I lived in a red district, but my neighbors were kind enough and graced me with the opportunity to go to the United States House of Representatives for 12 years to represent them. I learned how to compromise without compromising my values. And as governor of the great State of Minnesota, I brought all that experience.
Text: (01:33:07)Okay, okay. Are there Minnesotans in the house today? Bringing that experience to tackling the challenges that we’re facing in our state. We don’t shy away from challenges. But I’ll tell you what, Donald Trump, he sees the world differently than we see it. He has no understanding of service, because he’s too busy servicing himself.
Text: (01:33:44)Again and again and again, again and again and again, this guy weakens our country to strengthen his own hands. He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division amongst the people, and that’s to say nothing of the job he did as president. He froze in the face of COVID and it cost people’s lives. He drove the economy into the ground. And make no mistake about it, violent crime was up when Donald Trump was president.
Text: (01:34:26)Those of you who are a little older know this. Older Republicans used to talk about freedom. These guys today, it turns out that freedom to them means government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor. Now look, we’re pretty neighborly with Wisconsin. We get our friendly battles, but in Minnesota, just like in Wisconsin, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make, even if we wouldn’t make the same choices for ourselves, because we know there’s a golden rule. Mind your own damn business. Mind your own damn business.
Text: (01:35:12)I don’t need you telling me about our healthcare. I don’t need you telling us who we love, and I sure the hell don’t need you telling us what books we’re going to read. And there’s a very personal one for me, and that includes IVF. Some of you might’ve heard this. This is very personal for my wife and I.
Text: (01:35:36)When Gwen and I decided to have children, we went through years of fertility treatments, and I remember each night praying that the call was going to come and it was going to be good news. The phone would ring, tenseness in my stomach. And then the agony when you heard the treatments hadn’t worked. So, it wasn’t by chance that when we welcomed our first child, our beautiful daughter, we named her Hope.
Text: (01:36:08)When Vice President Harris and I, and everyone here, talks about freedom, we mean the freedom to make your own healthcare decisions. And for all of our little ones to be free to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in their classroom. And just like Wisconsin, over in Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in common sense gun violence laws.
Text: (01:36:48)And just so you know, when I was in Congress, I was the top gun at the trap shoot, three years in a row. I can out shoot them, too. I can out shoot these guys. Look, freedom is when-

Speaker: Speaker 6 (01:37:06):

Speaker: Tim Walz (01:37:06):

Speaker: Tim Walz (01:37:14):
Text: Drink some water, folks, it is hot out. Can somebody…

Speaker: Speaker 8 (01:37:17):

Speaker: Tim Walz (01:37:17):
Text: Thank you. You get water?

Speaker: Speaker 8 (01:37:40):
Text: They’re so weird.

Speaker: Speaker 4 (01:37:40):
Text: They’re so weird. They’re so weird. They’re so weird.

Speaker: Tim Walz (01:37:40):
Text: You okay?
------
Speaker: Speaker 7 (01:37:40):
Text: Thank you for helping.
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:37:58):
Text: Yeah. Thank you all for helping. Grateful. Thank you. Thank y’all. Take care of one another on this. This is why we gather. Look, it’s hot. It is hot. I’ll come again. They’ve got folks here. We make sure we’re okay.
Text: (01:38:19)But I have to tell you all again, in all seriousness, to come and gather like this, to talk about our freedoms, the ability to talk about what could be good. And I have to say this idea of caring for our neighbor and kindness and a hand up when somebody needs it, or just the sense of that people go through things and to be able to be there when they need it, that’s who we are. It’s not about mocking, it’s not name callings, and you see it amongst them. Yay. Thank you all.

Speaker: Speaker 9 (01:39:26):
Text: They’ve got water down there?

Speaker: Tim Walz (01:39:28):
Text: They do.

Speaker: Speaker 9 (01:39:28):
Text: Someone over here…

Speaker: Tim Walz (01:39:28):
Text: Thank you all. We’re okay. We have someone down. They’re treating him. They’re getting him some water and it’s good. He’s going to get up. You guys need some water, too? We’ll ask him. Teddy, can you see if they have some more water? That’d be great. Take care of your neighbors.
------
Speaker: Speaker 4 (01:39:43):
Text: [inaudible 01:39:46].
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:39:52):
Text: There we go. There we go. All right.
------
Speaker: Speaker 6 (01:40:02):
Text: Government Tim, we’re proud of you.
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:40:02):
Text: All right, folks. Hey, they’re getting him taken care of. I don’t want to be too lighthearted. I thought about doing the Minnesota rouser, but I thought that might be too much over here on you. Look, we’ll get them taken care of. You know what this is about? This is about when they talk about the freedoms that we heard. And freedom in education means that our teachers aren’t saddled with crippling debt when they go into this, that student loan debt.
Text: (01:40:28)And I’ll tell you what a big part of this is. We settle our political differences not through violence, but through our votes. The question is pretty simple. This election is all about asking that question: which direction will this country go in? Donald Trump knows the direction he wants to take us. He wants to take it back. He wants to do the things that you saw. But be very clear. Don’t believe him when he plays dumb. He knows exactly what he’s talking about. He knows exactly what Project 2025 will do in restricting and taking our freedoms. He knows that it rigs the economy for the super rich.
Text: (01:41:06)If he gets a chance to go back to the White House, it will be far worse than it was four years ago. Raising costs for the middle class, repealing the Affordable Care Act, gutting Social Security and Medicare, the very safety nets that protect people when they’re down. And of course, banning abortions across this country with or without Congress.
Text: (01:41:35)This is where we talk to our neighbors. Donald Trump is not for you or your family. And Trump’s running mate shares those same dangerous and backward beliefs. Just like all of us in regular America, we go to Yale and then we have our careers funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then you write a book about the place you grew up and you trash
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:42:00):
Text: That place. Come on, that’s not who Wisconsin is. That’s not who Minnesota is. We’re better than that. We’re better than that.
Text: (01:42:17)One of the best parts of this job is going to be, I can’t wait ’til the debate. Look, I’ve done this enough and I know bullies. And I’m not a name-caller, but what I am as a teacher, I observed things. So I want to tell you what I observed and you’ve observed about these guys when you see them, that it’s a very clear thing. Yes, they are creepy and weird as hell. You see it. You see it. This is not normal. This is not normal behavior. Nobody’s asking for this crazy stuff. So I’ll tell you what, you heard it from the vice president, you’ve heard her talk about this, we’re sure the hell not going back. We’re not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:43:08):
Text: We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:43:19):
Text: We damn sure aren’t. But it’s even more than that. This is a campaign about where we’re going and that’s a future where everyone matters and everyone’s included. Kamala Harris, she believes in the freedom to make your own choices. She believes an opportunity for every single person to join the middle class. And she believes in the promise of America.
Text: (01:43:48)Thank you Madam Vice President for the trust that you’ve placed in me. Wisconsin, please help me in giving a warm, Midwest welcome to the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris.
------
Speaker: MUSIC (01:44:02):
Text: Freedom.
Text: (01:44:02)Freedom.

Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:45:18):
Text: Good afternoon, Wisconsin.
Text: (01:45:18)Good afternoon. Oh, it’s good to be back. Good afternoon everybody. Can we hear it for Tim Walz? Oh, I’m so happy to be running with him, let me tell you.
Text: (01:45:33)So let me start by thanking Les, your words, your leadership, your voice it’s so important. Les, thank you for everything you are and everything you do for our country. And it is good to be with so many incredible leaders, including the most magnificent, wonderful governor, Tony Evers. Every time I come to Wisconsin, Tony meets me on the tarmac. He’s such an incredible human being. I want to thank Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski. Chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Ben Wickler. And my dear, dear friend, Senator Tammy Baldwin.
Text: (01:46:27)I served with Tammy when I was in the United States Senate and I’ma tell you, she was always, always fighting for the people of this state. And in November we are going to re-elect her to the United States Senate. And please, give it up one more time for Wisconsin’s own Bon Iver. It’s a good afternoon. It’s a good afternoon.
Text: (01:46:58)And let me say, I also want to bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. He loves Wisconsin, he loves Wisconsin. And I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation and for all he continues to do. That’s right.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:47:24):
Text: Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:47:45):
Text: That’s right. I’m going to tell him what you said.
Text: (01:47:51)So Wisconsin, this has been a big week.
------
Speaker: Speaker 10 (01:47:56):
Text: We’re going to win.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:47:59):
Text: On Monday, I officially became the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. And yesterday, I announced my running mate in this campaign, Governor Tim Walz. And as you just heard and the Minnesotans here know, Tim has an incredible record as governor of the great state of Minnesota. And to those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. To the people of Southern Minnesota for 12 years he was a congressman. To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. And to his former high school football players, he was Coach, Coach.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:49:15):
Text: Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach.
------
Speaker: Speaker 11 (01:49:15):
Text: We got your back.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:49:27):
Text: And in 90 days the nation will know Coach Walz by a new title, Vice President of the United States of America.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:49:38):
Text: VP Walz. VP Walz. VP Walz. VP Walz.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:49:51):
Text: That’s right. Oh, it really is good to be back in Wisconsin.
Text: (01:49:56)So listen, let me tell you, I am clear, the path to the White House runs right through this state. And with your help, we will win in November. We are going to win. We are going to win. And I’ve been here many times, as you all know, recently and even before. And many of you know then, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected United States senator, I was an elected attorney general. And before that, an elected district attorney. And before that and before that I was a courtroom prosecutor.
Text: (01:50:42)So in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators, who abused women. Fraudsters, who ripped off consumers. Scammers, who broke the rules for personal gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type. I know it’s type. In fact, I’ve been dealing with people like him my whole career. For example, as Attorney General of California… Well hold on, you know what? The courts are going to handle that part of it. What we’re going to do is beat them in November.
Text: (01:51:41)So I’ll tell you, as Attorney General, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.
Text: (01:51:55)As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
Text: (01:52:06)As Attorney General, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud, 34 counts.
Text: (01:52:22)So in this campaign, I’ll tell you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week. Any day of the week.
Text: (01:52:40)But let’s make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It’s about two very different visions for our nation. Two very different visions. One, for us, focused on the future. The other, focused on the past. And Wisconsin, we here, we fight for the future. We fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to join a union.
Text: (01:53:15)Union strong.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:53:21):
Text: Union strong. Union strong. Union strong. Union strong. Union strong.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:53:30):
Text: We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity. A future where we build a broad-based economy. And one where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build wealth. And understand in this fight, as Tim Walz likes to point out, we are joyful warriors. Joyful warriors because we know that while fighting for a brighter future may be hard work, hard work is good work, hard work is good work. And so, we will continue to fight for affordable housing, for affordable healthcare, affordable child care, and paid leave. We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America’s families so that they have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead.
Text: (01:54:50)Because while our economy is doing well, by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. When I was Attorney General, I went after price fixing schemes. And when I am president, it will be a day one priority to fight to bring down prices. I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging. I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families. I will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. And continue to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. And back to communities like Eau Claire.
Text: (01:55:49)So, all this is to say, strengthening our economy and building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because you see, Coach Walz and I know when America’s middle class is strong, America is strong. And as we work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to take our nation backward. There is so much evidence of that point, there really is. But look at most recently, Project 2025 and that agenda. Project 2025, if you have some time to take a look at it, I’m telling you it is a plan to weaken the middle class. It is a plan to weaken the middle class.
Text: (01:56:50)If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis. And he intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:57:14):
Text: No.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:57:16):
Text: And because we all remember what it was like before the Affordable Care Act, we understand what that means. That’s about taking us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember that?
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:57:32):
Text: Yes.
------
Speaker: Speaker 12 (01:57:36):
Text: We’re not going back.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:57:38):
Text: What that was like when… We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:57:38):
Text: We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:57:42):
Text: We are not going back. We are not going back.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:57:43):
Text: We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:57:48):
Text: But in order to know where we need to go, let’s remember the past and what that was like ’cause we cannot forget. On that point about the ACA, remember, people with pre- existing conditions being denied? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes, that was no joke.
Text: (01:58:08)Our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights. The freedom to vote, to love who you love openly and with pride. And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do.
Text: (01:58:34)And let’s remember the traditions of our great country. Generations of Americans before us led in the fight for freedom. And now then, as they would expect, the baton is in our hands. The baton is in our hands, each and every one of us. So we then, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. We, who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws and an assault weapons ban. We, who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman’s right to choose.
Text: (01:59:41)And we, remember that when he was president, Donald Trump hand-picked three members of the United States Supreme Court, the court of Thurgood and RBG, because he intended for them to overturn Roe v wade. And, as he intended, they did. And now, more than 20 states in our country have a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. And if he wins, we all know he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every state, even in Wisconsin.
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:00:24):
Text: No!
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:00:27):
Text: But we are not going to let that happen.
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:00:31):
Text: No.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:00:31):
Text: Because we trust women.
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:00:36):
Text: Yes!
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:00:36):
Text: And when I am President of the United States and when Congress passes a bill to restore the protections of Roe v wade, I will sign it into law.
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:01:06):
Text: Kamala. Kamala. Kamala. Kamala. Kamala.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:01:07):
Text: Thank you all.
Text: (02:01:08)So listen, everyone took time out of your busy lives, and days and all your obligations to come out here and to be together as one community. And I know you did it also because we all know, listen, so much is on the line in this election. It can’t be said seriously enough. So much is on the line. And compounded with everything else that we knew was on the line, think about the fact that last month the United States Supreme Court, basically, told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that going forward he will be immune, no matter what he does in the White House.
Text: (02:01:53)Think about what that means and the changed circumstances since 16/6/20 when you think about what that court decision means. Donald Trump has openly vowed if re-elected, he will be a dictator on day one. That he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. That he would round up peaceful protesters and throw them out of our country. And even, “Terminate the United States Constitution.” So let us be clear, let us be clear, someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have a chance to stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. So basically, I think it all comes down to this, we’re all here because we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. And that’s how we preserve the promise of America ’cause, after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible, by the way, for Governor Walz and me to stand on this stage today. Just think about it, two middle-class kids one, a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother and had a summer job at McDonald’s. The other, a son of the Nebraska Plains who grew up working on a farm. Think about that. Only in America is it possible for them, together, to make it all the way together to the White House. Only in America. Only in America.
Text: (02:04:27)So this is a fight to make real the promise of America for every person in our nation. And also I’ll tell you, and I promise you, our campaign’s going to reach out to everyone, from red states, from blue states, from the heartland to the coast. We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans. And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans because Coach Walz and I know, and we’re clear about this unlike the other side, we work for you. We work for you, the American people. And we will always fight for you, for your family, for your freedoms, and for your future.
Text: (02:05:19)So Wisconsin, ultimately, this election is about a question that we each face. We each face a question in this election. And that is, what kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom, of compassion, of rule of law?
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:05:43):
Text: Yes.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:05:45):
Text: Or a country of chaos, fear and hate?
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:05:47):
Text: No.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:05:50):
Text: And the beauty of our democracy is we each have the power individually and collectively. We each have the power in a democracy to answer that question. The power is with the people. The power is with the people.
Text: (02:06:17)So in the next 90 days, we need you to use your power. We need you to knock on doors. We need you to register folks to vote. We need you to energize, and organize, and mobilize and make your voices heard.
Text: (02:06:39)And I’ll tell you about an hour ago after I landed on Air Force 2, I met a collection of young leaders from Girl Scout Troop 3307. Oh, they were spectacular. Oh, they were spectacular. None of them taller than three feet. They all made just… They were spectacular. And one of those young leaders had a shirt on that said, “You are powerful and your voice matters.” Right? From the mouths of babes they’re telling us, they’re telling us. And so, let’s remember that. Let’s remember our power. Let’s remember our voice matters. And with that then I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard?
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:07:26):
Text: Yes.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:07:32):
Text: Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America?
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:07:38):
Text: Yes!
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:07:39):
Text: And are we ready to fight for it?
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:07:42):
Text: Yes!
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:07:42):
Text: And when we fight, we win.
Text: (02:07:47)God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

Text: (01:10)Wisconsin, we have just 90 days to make sure that we elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, and send them to the White House. And our work together begins here today. At the top of the ticket, we’ve got that incredible Vice President, Kamala Harris. She has spent the last four years vigorously defending our democracy, fighting to protect the freedoms that we hold dear, and very tirelessly working to do the right thing and deliver for us.
Text: (01:47)Then you have my good friend and our next-door neighbor, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. And Wisconsin, you know what happens when you elect a former teacher, don’t you? We go hog wild getting things done. We always do what’s best for our kids and working families. We work to find common ground and consensus, and we lead with kindness, respect, and compassion. And those are the exact Midwestern values, qualities, and work ethic that will make Tim a great vice president. And folks, I’m so excited about this iconic duo. Kamala and Tim go together like custard and curds, like cream puffs and the state fair, like old fashioned and french fries, polka and euchre, brats and beer. So, I’m going to ask you, Wisconsin, are you all in to win?
------
Speaker: Crowd (03:05):
Text: Yeah!
------
Speaker: Tony Evers (03:08):
Text: Good, because we have a hell of a lot of work to do. We have 90 days, and we do not have a minute to waste, because here’s the truth about the other two jokers in this race. Donald Trump and J. D. Vance are a dangerous threat to our country and our democracy. They’re not running to help others, folks. They’re running to serve themselves. They’re not capable of the truth or telling it. And Donald Trump and J. D. Vance have a radical agenda that they plan to pursue if they get to the office. Obviously, you’ve googled Project 2025, right?
------
Speaker: Crowd (03:54):
Text: Yeah.

Speaker: Tony Evers (03:55):
Text: Seriously, look it up if you haven’t when you get home. We all know that Donald Trump and J. D. Vance will work to enact a national abortion ban. His running mate, J. D. Vance, said he’d like abortion to be, quote, “illegal nationally”. I think Wisconsin women will have something to say about that. Women here in Wisconsin already spent a year experiencing what it is like to live in a state that bans nearly all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest. And you know what we’re going to tell Donald Trump, J. D. Vance, and the Republicans up and down the ballot on November 5th? Which is my birthday. We are not going back.

Let’s go win this damn thing. Let’s win! Thank you!

Text: Please welcome United States Senator Tammy Baldwin.
------
Speaker: MUSIC (06:39):
Text: Ain’t no stoppin’ us now.
Text: (06:44)We’re on the move.
Text: (06:44)Ain’t no stoppin’ us now.
Text: (06:51)We’ve got the groove.
------
Speaker: Tammy Baldwin (07:08):
Text: Hello, Wisconsin! I am so proud to be here today. Today, as we stand here, we mark a new beginning for our party and our country as we welcome our presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, back to our state. Now, as California Attorney General, Kamala Harris was the top prosecutor for the largest state in the nation, standing up for the rule of law and taking on perpetrators of all kinds, which is exactly the kind of experience that will come in handy at a moment like this. As a United States senator, I was always riveted to watch her, on the Judiciary Committee, hold the powerful to account. And as vice president, she fought fervently to restore reproductive freedom after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. I am so proud to support Kamala for president of the United States.
Text: (08:25)And so I also want to recognize the next vice president of the United States, Governor Tim Walz. As a military veteran, a teacher, and a true public servant, he is a fantastic addition to the Democratic ticket. Now, when he and I served in the House of Representatives together, we worked together to stand up for our dairy farmers. And while serving as governor of our neighboring state, Minnesota, we worked together to bring $1 billion for a new bridge in Superior, Wisconsin that’ll connect our two states, create jobs, bolster our economy, and make sure our families can get to work on time.
Text: (09:22)In picking a fellow Midwesterner, it is clear that this campaign knows that the path to the presidency, and to control of the United States Senate, runs directly through the Midwest. And that means it runs directly through Wisconsin, because we are the battleground state. Wisconsin is likely to decide who our next president is, and who controls the United States Senate. And Wisconsin, speaking of that US Senate seat, I’m being challenged by a self-funding multimillionaire by the name of Eric Hovde.
------
Speaker: Crowd (10:06):
Text: Boo!
------
Speaker: Tammy Baldwin (10:11):
Text: Now, Hovde owns a $3 billion California bank, a $7 million ocean view home in Laguna Beach, and he’s been named one of the influential residents of Orange County three years in a row. Folks, we have a Green County, Wisconsin, we have a Brown County, Wisconsin, but there’s no Orange County, Wisconsin. And you may laugh at that, but the stakes of this race are really high. Hovde celebrated when Roe was overturned. He said he’s 100% anti-choice. Meanwhile, I am leading the effort to restore reproductive freedoms with my Women’s Health Protection Act. On healthcare, my opponent wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and kick millions off of their health insurance. Living without health insurance throughout my youth, due to a childhood illness, is why I got into public service to begin with. I wrote the provision in the Affordable Care Act that allows young people to stay on their parents’ insurance until they turn 26. And I will never stop fighting until all Americans have the quality affordable healthcare they need and deserve. On the economy, Eric Hovde wants to cut Social Security and Medicare, while giving new tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy and well-connected, like himself. As your senator, I will always fight to bring down costs for working families, and make sure that multi-millionaires, like my opponent, pay their fair share.
Text: (12:14)Now, with Eric Hovde, it’s more than just the issues. He’s insulted just about everyone in our state. He’s called farmers “lazy”. He said seniors in nursing homes shouldn’t have the right to vote. He told kids of single moms that they’re likely to be poor and on drugs. He even said that people who are struggling with their weight should pay more for their health insurance. Can you believe it? It’s clear that he has spent more time on his private beach in California than on a factory floor or a family farm here in Wisconsin. We need to defeat him, not only to protect the rights and freedoms that we hold dear, not only to continue to deliver for working families, but because Wisconsinites actually deserve a senator who understands them, not one who insults them.

Text: (01:22:03)A yearning, yeah, and it’s real to me.
Text: (01:22:03)There must be someone who’s feeling for me.
Text: (01:22:03)Things look so bad everywhere.
Text: (01:22:03)In this whole world, what is fair?

Text: Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily.
Text: (01:24:04)You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks.

Text: (01:24:04)World.

Text: (01:24:04)I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped.
Text: (01:24:04)Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl.

Speaker: Les Danielson (01:24:14):
Text: Good afternoon. My name is Les Danielson and I’m a fourth generation farmer, born and raised in Cadott. I’ve been farming right here in the Chippewa Valley my entire life. In 1884, my great-grandfather, Dan Danielson, moved to the Chippewa Valley and homesteaded our original farm.
Text: (01:24:34)My grandfather, William, continued on with a family farm, followed by my father, Wayne. Today, my two brothers and I all farm in the same area in Cadott, just over 20 minutes from here. My extended family still farms the same land my great-grandparents did, and we look forward to farming it for years to come. My wife, Debra and I, purchased 700 acres of our own land and now grow 500 acres of corn, soybeans, and some hay. We built our grain setup and milk a small herd of cows.
Text: (01:25:08)My story’s a Wisconsin story, one of hard work and perseverance, and that’s why I’m glad and excited that Vice President Harris’ running mate is a lifelong Midwesterner, just like me, who’ll always fight for working families and understands rural America. As a kid from Cadott, I’m very proud to stand on this stage today as we welcome the next President and Vice President of the United States to the Chippewa Valley.
Text: (01:25:48)Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz know that rural America is the backbone of our nation. It’s family farms like mine that feed our country and it’s small businesses in towns like Cadott that keep our economy strong. But while Donald Trump was in office, my brothers and I saw firsthand his disastrous trade wars and economic policies, which left many farmers, like us, struggling, and devastated small and mid-sized grain farms.
Text: (01:26:24)Trump stands on the side of Big Ag, Big Oil, and giant corporations, not family farms. And he made it harder for us to compete. Together with President Biden, Kamala Harris has fought for rural communities, whether it’s through fixing our roads and bridges so we can get products to markets or fighting to expand affordable healthcare or helping family farms like mine.
Text: (01:26:55)Donald Trump and JD fans just don’t care about rural America, no matter how much they pretend to. That’s why this November, I’m voting for Kamala Harris and Governor Walz. And now it’s my honor to introduce our future vice president, Governor Tim Walz.

Speaker: MUSIC (01:27:16):
Text: In the day we sweat it out on the streets.
Text: (01:27:16)Of a runaway American dream.
Text: (01:27:16)At night we ride through the mansions of glory.
Text: (01:27:16)In suicide machines.
Text: (01:27:16)Sprung from cages on Highway 9.
Text: (01:27:16)Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin’ out over the line.
Text: (01:27:16)Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back.
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:28:06):
Text: Wow. Wow. Wow. Hello, Eau Claire. Isn’t it good to have a candidate who can pronounce the name correctly? Wow. Les, thank you. Thank you for the introduction. More importantly, thank you for articulating what we know it means to live out here in the Midwest: care for your neighbors, kindness.
Text: (01:28:37)I want to acknowledge a few people today. Somebody who I have to tell you might be the kindest human being I have ever met. Your governor, Tony Evers. A dear friend of mine who I had a chance to serve with in the House of Representatives, an incredible senator, Tammy Baldwin. The people’s lawyer, your Attorney General Josh Kaul. And someone who knows education’s a foundation of everything, State Superintendent Jill Underly. All the state and local officials are here, but I want to say that, putting a personal privilege on this, I got a bunch of my family down here in the front, so… A couple of them are Badgers too, by the way, so.
Text: (01:29:53)And a real special thank you to everybody here. Looking out across here, look, you’re busy people. You got things to do. It’s a summer day. You had to walk two miles. I had nothing to do with that, by the way, nothing. But you came here for one beautiful, simple reason. You love this country and this democracy.
Text: (01:30:22)I couldn’t be prouder to be on this ticket to help make Kamala Harris the next President of the United States. You know it. Vice President Harris is on the side of the American people. She took on predators, fraudsters, transnational gang members. She stood up against powerful corporate interests and she never hesitated, not once, to reach across the aisle if it improved people’s lives.
Text: (01:30:57)Being a Midwesterner, too, I know a little something about commitment to people. I was born in a small town in Nebraska where community meant everything. My mom and dad taught me to show generosity to my neighbors and work for a common good. At 17, I joined the Army National Guard. For 24 years, I proudly wore the uniform of this nation.
Text: (01:31:27)And that service, just as it did for my dad, a Korean War veteran, and millions of others, I got the GI Bill and it gave me a shot at a college education. My dad was a teacher. My siblings were all teachers. And three of them married teachers. It’s noble work. I had the privilege of teaching public school social studies and coaching football for 20 years. And for all you Packers and Badgers fans, yes, we did win a state championship, so it’s what we do.
Text: (01:32:14)But it was my students who encouraged me to run for office. I never thought that much about it, but they saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them. This idea of a commitment to a better world, a common good, a belief that one single person can actually make a difference.
Text: (01:32:39)I lived in a red district, but my neighbors were kind enough and graced me with the opportunity to go to the United States House of Representatives for 12 years to represent them. I learned how to compromise without compromising my values. And as governor of the great State of Minnesota, I brought all that experience.
Text: (01:33:07)Okay, okay. Are there Minnesotans in the house today? Bringing that experience to tackling the challenges that we’re facing in our state. We don’t shy away from challenges. But I’ll tell you what, Donald Trump, he sees the world differently than we see it. He has no understanding of service, because he’s too busy servicing himself.
Text: (01:33:44)Again and again and again, again and again and again, this guy weakens our country to strengthen his own hands. He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division amongst the people, and that’s to say nothing of the job he did as president. He froze in the face of COVID and it cost people’s lives. He drove the economy into the ground. And make no mistake about it, violent crime was up when Donald Trump was president.
Text: (01:34:26)Those of you who are a little older know this. Older Republicans used to talk about freedom. These guys today, it turns out that freedom to them means government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor. Now look, we’re pretty neighborly with Wisconsin. We get our friendly battles, but in Minnesota, just like in Wisconsin, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make, even if we wouldn’t make the same choices for ourselves, because we know there’s a golden rule. Mind your own damn business. Mind your own damn business.
Text: (01:35:12)I don’t need you telling me about our healthcare. I don’t need you telling us who we love, and I sure the hell don’t need you telling us what books we’re going to read. And there’s a very personal one for me, and that includes IVF. Some of you might’ve heard this. This is very personal for my wife and I.
Text: (01:35:36)When Gwen and I decided to have children, we went through years of fertility treatments, and I remember each night praying that the call was going to come and it was going to be good news. The phone would ring, tenseness in my stomach. And then the agony when you heard the treatments hadn’t worked. So, it wasn’t by chance that when we welcomed our first child, our beautiful daughter, we named her Hope.
Text: (01:36:08)When Vice President Harris and I, and everyone here, talks about freedom, we mean the freedom to make your own healthcare decisions. And for all of our little ones to be free to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in their classroom. And just like Wisconsin, over in Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in common sense gun violence laws.
Text: (01:36:48)And just so you know, when I was in Congress, I was the top gun at the trap shoot, three years in a row. I can out shoot them, too. I can out shoot these guys. Look, freedom is when-

Speaker: Speaker 5 (01:37:00):
Text: [inaudible 01:37:00] somebody down.

Speaker: Tim Walz (01:37:03):
Text: Can we get somebody to help? Somebody’s hot.
------
Speaker: Speaker 6 (01:37:06):
Text: Somebody help her.
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:37:06):
Text: Somebody’s hot. Can we get somebody to help? You okay?
------
Speaker: Speaker 7 (01:37:10):
Text: Hurry up.
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:37:14):
Text: Drink some water, folks, it is hot out. Can somebody…
------
Speaker: Speaker 8 (01:37:17):
Text: You’re a good man, [inaudible 01:37:17].
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:37:17):
Text: Thank you. You get water?
------
Speaker: Speaker 8 (01:37:40):
Text: They’re so weird.
------
Speaker: Speaker 4 (01:37:40):
Text: They’re so weird. They’re so weird. They’re so weird.
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:37:40):
Text: You okay?
------
Speaker: Speaker 7 (01:37:40):
Text: Thank you for helping.
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:37:58):
Text: Yeah. Thank you all for helping. Grateful. Thank you. Thank y’all. Take care of one another on this. This is why we gather. Look, it’s hot. It is hot. I’ll come again. They’ve got folks here. We make sure we’re okay.
Text: (01:38:19)But I have to tell you all again, in all seriousness, to come and gather like this, to talk about our freedoms, the ability to talk about what could be good. And I have to say this idea of caring for our neighbor and kindness and a hand up when somebody needs it, or just the sense of that people go through things and to be able to be there when they need it, that’s who we are. It’s not about mocking, it’s not name callings, and you see it amongst them. Yay. Thank you all.
------
Speaker: Speaker 9 (01:39:26):
Text: They’ve got water down there?
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:39:28):
Text: They do.
------
Speaker: Speaker 9 (01:39:28):
Text: Someone over here…
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:39:28):
Text: Thank you all. We’re okay. We have someone down. They’re treating him. They’re getting him some water and it’s good. He’s going to get up. You guys need some water, too? We’ll ask him. Teddy, can you see if they have some more water? That’d be great. Take care of your neighbors.
------
Speaker: Speaker 4 (01:39:43):
Text: [inaudible 01:39:46].
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:39:52):
Text: There we go. There we go. All right.
------
Speaker: Speaker 6 (01:40:02):
Text: Government Tim, we’re proud of you.
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:40:02):
Text: All right, folks. Hey, they’re getting him taken care of. I don’t want to be too lighthearted. I thought about doing the Minnesota rouser, but I thought that might be too much over here on you. Look, we’ll get them taken care of. You know what this is about? This is about when they talk about the freedoms that we heard. And freedom in education means that our teachers aren’t saddled with crippling debt when they go into this, that student loan debt.
Text: (01:40:28)And I’ll tell you what a big part of this is. We settle our political differences not through violence, but through our votes. The question is pretty simple. This election is all about asking that question: which direction will this country go in? Donald Trump knows the direction he wants to take us. He wants to take it back. He wants to do the things that you saw. But be very clear. Don’t believe him when he plays dumb. He knows exactly what he’s talking about. He knows exactly what Project 2025 will do in restricting and taking our freedoms. He knows that it rigs the economy for the super rich.
Text: (01:41:06)If he gets a chance to go back to the White House, it will be far worse than it was four years ago. Raising costs for the middle class, repealing the Affordable Care Act, gutting Social Security and Medicare, the very safety nets that protect people when they’re down. And of course, banning abortions across this country with or without Congress.
Text: (01:41:35)This is where we talk to our neighbors. Donald Trump is not for you or your family. And Trump’s running mate shares those same dangerous and backward beliefs. Just like all of us in regular America, we go to Yale and then we have our careers funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then you write a book about the place you grew up and you trash
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:42:00):
Text: That place. Come on, that’s not who Wisconsin is. That’s not who Minnesota is. We’re better than that. We’re better than that.
Text: (01:42:17)One of the best parts of this job is going to be, I can’t wait ’til the debate. Look, I’ve done this enough and I know bullies. And I’m not a name-caller, but what I am as a teacher, I observed things. So I want to tell you what I observed and you’ve observed about these guys when you see them, that it’s a very clear thing. Yes, they are creepy and weird as hell. You see it. You see it. This is not normal. This is not normal behavior. Nobody’s asking for this crazy stuff. So I’ll tell you what, you heard it from the vice president, you’ve heard her talk about this, we’re sure the hell not going back. We’re not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:43:08):
Text: We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
------
Speaker: Tim Walz (01:43:19):
Text: We damn sure aren’t. But it’s even more than that. This is a campaign about where we’re going and that’s a future where everyone matters and everyone’s included. Kamala Harris, she believes in the freedom to make your own choices. She believes an opportunity for every single person to join the middle class. And she believes in the promise of America.
Text: (01:43:48)Thank you Madam Vice President for the trust that you’ve placed in me. Wisconsin, please help me in giving a warm, Midwest welcome to the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris.
------
Speaker: MUSIC (01:44:02):
Text: Freedom.
Text: (01:44:02)Freedom.
Text: (01:44:02)I can’t move.
Text: (01:44:02)Freedom, cut me loose.
Text: (01:44:02)Hey, hey.
Text: (01:44:02)Freedom.
Text: (01:44:02)Freedom.
Text: (01:44:02)Where are you?
Text: (01:44:02)‘Cause I need freedom, too.
Text: (01:44:02)I break chains all by myself.
Text: (01:44:02)Won’t let my freedom rot in hell.
Text: (01:44:02)Hey!
Text: (01:44:02)I’ma keep running.
Text: (01:44:02)‘Cause a winner don’t quit on themselves.
Text: (01:44:02)I’ma wade, I’ma wave through the waters.
Text: (01:44:02)Tell the tide, “Don’t move.”
Text: (01:44:02)I’ma riot, I’ma riot through your borders.
Text: (01:44:02)Call me bulletproof.
Text: (01:44:02)Lord forgive me, I’ve been runnin.
Text: (01:44:02)‘Runnin’ blind in truth.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:45:18):
Text: Good afternoon, Wisconsin.
Text: (01:45:18)Good afternoon. Oh, it’s good to be back. Good afternoon everybody. Can we hear it for Tim Walz? Oh, I’m so happy to be running with him, let me tell you.
Text: (01:45:33)So let me start by thanking Les, your words, your leadership, your voice it’s so important. Les, thank you for everything you are and everything you do for our country. And it is good to be with so many incredible leaders, including the most magnificent, wonderful governor, Tony Evers. Every time I come to Wisconsin, Tony meets me on the tarmac. He’s such an incredible human being. I want to thank Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski. Chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Ben Wickler. And my dear, dear friend, Senator Tammy Baldwin.
Text: (01:46:27)I served with Tammy when I was in the United States Senate and I’ma tell you, she was always, always fighting for the people of this state. And in November we are going to re-elect her to the United States Senate. And please, give it up one more time for Wisconsin’s own Bon Iver. It’s a good afternoon. It’s a good afternoon.
Text: (01:46:58)And let me say, I also want to bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. He loves Wisconsin, he loves Wisconsin. And I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation and for all he continues to do. That’s right.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:47:24):
Text: Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:47:45):
Text: That’s right. I’m going to tell him what you said.
Text: (01:47:51)So Wisconsin, this has been a big week.
------
Speaker: Speaker 10 (01:47:56):
Text: We’re going to win.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:47:59):
Text: On Monday, I officially became the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. And yesterday, I announced my running mate in this campaign, Governor Tim Walz. And as you just heard and the Minnesotans here know, Tim has an incredible record as governor of the great state of Minnesota. And to those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. To the people of Southern Minnesota for 12 years he was a congressman. To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. And to his former high school football players, he was Coach, Coach.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:49:15):
Text: Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach.
------
Speaker: Speaker 11 (01:49:15):
Text: We got your back.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:49:27):
Text: And in 90 days the nation will know Coach Walz by a new title, Vice President of the United States of America.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:49:38):
Text: VP Walz. VP Walz. VP Walz. VP Walz.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:49:51):
Text: That’s right. Oh, it really is good to be back in Wisconsin.
Text: (01:49:56)So listen, let me tell you, I am clear, the path to the White House runs right through this state. And with your help, we will win in November. We are going to win. We are going to win. And I’ve been here many times, as you all know, recently and even before. And many of you know then, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected United States senator, I was an elected attorney general. And before that, an elected district attorney. And before that and before that I was a courtroom prosecutor.
Text: (01:50:42)So in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators, who abused women. Fraudsters, who ripped off consumers. Scammers, who broke the rules for personal gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type. I know it’s type. In fact, I’ve been dealing with people like him my whole career. For example, as Attorney General of California… Well hold on, you know what? The courts are going to handle that part of it. What we’re going to do is beat them in November.
Text: (01:51:41)So I’ll tell you, as Attorney General, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.
Text: (01:51:55)As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
Text: (01:52:06)As Attorney General, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud, 34 counts.
Text: (01:52:22)So in this campaign, I’ll tell you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week. Any day of the week.
Text: (01:52:40)But let’s make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It’s about two very different visions for our nation. Two very different visions. One, for us, focused on the future. The other, focused on the past. And Wisconsin, we here, we fight for the future. We fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to join a union.
Text: (01:53:15)Union strong.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:53:21):
Text: Union strong. Union strong. Union strong. Union strong. Union strong.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:53:30):
Text: We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity. A future where we build a broad-based economy. And one where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build wealth. And understand in this fight, as Tim Walz likes to point out, we are joyful warriors. Joyful warriors because we know that while fighting for a brighter future may be hard work, hard work is good work, hard work is good work. And so, we will continue to fight for affordable housing, for affordable healthcare, affordable child care, and paid leave. We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America’s families so that they have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead.
Text: (01:54:50)Because while our economy is doing well, by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. When I was Attorney General, I went after price fixing schemes. And when I am president, it will be a day one priority to fight to bring down prices. I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging. I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families. I will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. And continue to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. And back to communities like Eau Claire.
Text: (01:55:49)So, all this is to say, strengthening our economy and building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because you see, Coach Walz and I know when America’s middle class is strong, America is strong. And as we work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to take our nation backward. There is so much evidence of that point, there really is. But look at most recently, Project 2025 and that agenda. Project 2025, if you have some time to take a look at it, I’m telling you it is a plan to weaken the middle class. It is a plan to weaken the middle class.
Text: (01:56:50)If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis. And he intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:57:14):
Text: No.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:57:16):
Text: And because we all remember what it was like before the Affordable Care Act, we understand what that means. That’s about taking us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember that?
------
Speaker: Crowd (01:57:32):
Text: Yes.
------
Speaker: Speaker 12 (01:57:36):
Text: We’re not going back.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:57:38):
Text: What that was like when… We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.

Speaker: Kamala Harris (01:57:48):
Text: But in order to know where we need to go, let’s remember the past and what that was like ’cause we cannot forget. On that point about the ACA, remember, people with pre- existing conditions being denied? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes, that was no joke.
Text: (01:58:08)Our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights. The freedom to vote, to love who you love openly and with pride. And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do.
Text: (01:58:34)And let’s remember the traditions of our great country. Generations of Americans before us led in the fight for freedom. And now then, as they would expect, the baton is in our hands. The baton is in our hands, each and every one of us. So we then, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. We, who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws and an assault weapons ban. We, who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman’s right to choose.
Text: (01:59:41)And we, remember that when he was president, Donald Trump hand-picked three members of the United States Supreme Court, the court of Thurgood and RBG, because he intended for them to overturn Roe v wade. And, as he intended, they did. And now, more than 20 states in our country have a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. And if he wins, we all know he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every state, even in Wisconsin.

Speaker: Crowd (02:00:24):
Text: No!
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:00:27):
Text: But we are not going to let that happen.
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:00:31):
Text: No.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:00:31):
Text: Because we trust women.
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:00:36):
Text: Yes!
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:00:36):
Text: And when I am President of the United States and when Congress passes a bill to restore the protections of Roe v wade, I will sign it into law.
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:01:06):
Text: Kamala. Kamala. Kamala. Kamala. Kamala.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:01:07):
Text: Thank you all.
Text: (02:01:08)So listen, everyone took time out of your busy lives, and days and all your obligations to come out here and to be together as one community. And I know you did it also because we all know, listen, so much is on the line in this election. It can’t be said seriously enough. So much is on the line. And compounded with everything else that we knew was on the line, think about the fact that last month the United States Supreme Court, basically, told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that going forward he will be immune, no matter what he does in the White House.
Text: (02:01:53)Think about what that means and the changed circumstances since 16/6/20 when you think about what that court decision means. Donald Trump has openly vowed if re-elected, he will be a dictator on day one. That he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. That he would round up peaceful protesters and throw them out of our country. And even, “Terminate the United States Constitution.” So let us be clear, let us be clear, someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have a chance to stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. So basically, I think it all comes down to this, we’re all here because we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. And that’s how we preserve the promise of America ’cause, after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible, by the way, for Governor Walz and me to stand on this stage today. Just think about it, two middle-class kids one, a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother and had a summer job at McDonald’s. The other, a son of the Nebraska Plains who grew up working on a farm. Think about that. Only in America is it possible for them, together, to make it all the way together to the White House. Only in America. Only in America.
Text: (02:04:27)So this is a fight to make real the promise of America for every person in our nation. And also I’ll tell you, and I promise you, our campaign’s going to reach out to everyone, from red states, from blue states, from the heartland to the coast. We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans. And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans because Coach Walz and I know, and we’re clear about this unlike the other side, we work for you. We work for you, the American people. And we will always fight for you, for your family, for your freedoms, and for your future.
Text: (02:05:19)So Wisconsin, ultimately, this election is about a question that we each face. We each face a question in this election. And that is, what kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom, of compassion, of rule of law?
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:05:43):
Text: Yes.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:05:45):
Text: Or a country of chaos, fear and hate?
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:05:47):
Text: No.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:05:50):
Text: And the beauty of our democracy is we each have the power individually and collectively. We each have the power in a democracy to answer that question. The power is with the people. The power is with the people.
Text: (02:06:17)So in the next 90 days, we need you to use your power. We need you to knock on doors. We need you to register folks to vote. We need you to energize, and organize, and mobilize and make your voices heard.
Text: (02:06:39)And I’ll tell you about an hour ago after I landed on Air Force 2, I met a collection of young leaders from Girl Scout Troop 3307. Oh, they were spectacular. Oh, they were spectacular. None of them taller than three feet. They all made just… They were spectacular. And one of those young leaders had a shirt on that said, “You are powerful and your voice matters.” Right? From the mouths of babes they’re telling us, they’re telling us. And so, let’s remember that. Let’s remember our power. Let’s remember our voice matters. And with that then I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard?
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:07:26):
Text: Yes.
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:07:32):
Text: Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America?
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:07:38):
Text: Yes!
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:07:39):
Text: And are we ready to fight for it?
------
Speaker: Crowd (02:07:42):
Text: Yes!
------
Speaker: Kamala Harris (02:07:42):
Text: And when we fight, we win.
Text: (02:07:47)God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
