Speaker: Eric Fink (00:07):
Text: And we begin with breaking news tonight. President Joe Biden has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, ending his reelection bid. Earlier today, he released this letter to the nation saying, “While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.” And one hour after posting that letter on X, the 46th president then posting a photo with Vice President Kamala Harris, offering his full support and endorsing Harris to become the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee.
Text: (00:45)Good evening, everybody. Thank you for being with us tonight on this consequential night in American history. I’m Eric Fink. This historic news comes with just three and a half months to go in the campaign for the White House, and after a lengthy pressure campaign from fellow Democrats that began after the President’s much criticized debate performance late last month. And tonight, we learn new filings with the Federal Election Commission Show the Biden for President Committee has changed its name now to the Harris for President Committee, this move upending this presidential contest with a little more than a hundred days to go before election day. President Biden now writes a new chapter in his legacy.
Text: (01:25)A sharp Turn for history, as President Biden announced Sunday morning, there would be no last campaign for him. Then, in a separate statement, the president embraced his vice president saying, in part, “I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,” a move that attempts to blunt any effort to open the nomination process before the August convention.” The president had praised Harris in a press conference that was intended in part to settle doubts about his candidacy.

Speaker: Joe Biden (01:58):
Text: Look, I wouldn’t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if I think she was not qualified to be president, so let’s start there.

Speaker: Eric Fink (02:07):
Text: The vice president offering thanks to the Bidens and making her intentions clear, writing in part in a statement, “I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party and unite our nation to defeat Donald Trump.” Reaction tonight from former President Barack Obama, who called Joe Biden “a patriot of the highest order,” describing the decision as “a testament to Joe Biden’s love of country.” Praise from Bill and Hilary Clinton for his “extraordinary career of service,” while highlighting their worry about “the threat posed by a second Trump term.” After a half a century of public life, his political brand was forged by being underestimated.

Speaker: Joe Biden (02:47):
Text: I know, like millions of Americas know, when you get knocked down, you get back up.

Speaker: Eric Fink (02:54):
Text: The president had tried to save his shot at a second term.

Speaker: Joe Biden (02:57):
Text: And I would not be running again if I didn’t believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job.

Speaker: Eric Fink (03:02):
Text: But that did not quiet the pressure after that June debate performance.

Speaker: Joe Biden (03:07):
Text: Look, if we finally beat Medicare.

Speaker: Eric Fink (03:12):
Text: An extraordinary ruptured followed, a chorus of rejection that grew louder for weeks.
------
Speaker: Joe Manchin (03:18):
Text: I think it’s time for a new generation to try to heal the party and heal the country.
------
Speaker: Speaker 5 (03:22):
Text: The president is not capable of delivering the message in an effective way.
------
Speaker: Speaker 6 (03:26):
Text: I don’t think he should stay in.
